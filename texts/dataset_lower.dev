first , the central father-son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his wong fei hung film `` drunken master '' ( ideas from this film recur in `` drunken master ii ) , and not `` young master '' ; that chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly ; and , indeed , the film conveys a sense of being incomplete ; for instance , the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film .

tarkovsky , is one .

in other words , kasdan jettisons conventional dramatic structure in favor of an exploration of the the ongoingness of life  there is no happy ending , only an eventual ending ; and everything before that is still in process , still always up for grabs  and , if you absolutely insist on a theme , an exploration of the role of the miraculous in our lives .

despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society , you never get the sense that clinton reed is placing his own life at risk { some viewers have noted that reed never inoculated himself against the plague , though i think it 's safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff } .

liza minelli , who usually overacts , did quite a good job in this one , and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn .
and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike 's work , the layers of meaning and metaphor , particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly , is pretty damn poignant .

without a doubt , this is one of the most successful , fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived .
luke stays worried about killing his own dad , and says that he feels that his father still has kindness .
the comedy is n't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay are n't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there , without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue .
and do n't get me started about the poster.this is still a great movie , 40 years after it was released .

mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues .
and annie galipeau , wow , what a beauty , and very convincing as an indian woman ( i believe she is french-canadian ; she sure reverts to the all-too familiar speech of such ) .
i know , i know , actors doing their job & acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases , explosions & fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat , but it does actually happen in this film.this brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker & not the spoon-fed tabloid reader - apart from a solid script , direction & acting , it relies on atmosphere , suspense & implied horror .

a character appears on the bus in mid-trip without explanation or introduction , and occassionally sits next to the others , and they look at her like she does n't belong .

a prime example of this comes directly after the boys ' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet .
of course , it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect ; if it had been made a year later , you can bet things would have been a bit different.yes , much of the novel , and many of its most interesting parts , are left on the cutting room floor , and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else .
clooney 's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam rockwell and luiz guzman can easily make it on their own .
cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died .
having really only seen him in la law before , i was blown away by his acting.the sequel the dentist 2 is also worth watching , but slightly under par compared to the original.ttkk 's bottomline - a fun movie with some scenes that will make you cringe , capped ( pun intended ) by a great performance from bernsen

though dana andrews was a minor star , he may be the quintessential forties man .
the atmospherics are first-rate , with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well-conceived.in the supporting cast , jean hersholt stands out as the vile villain who tries forcing pickford to marry him .

this is the first of a two part back-story to the conflict between the machines and mankind in the matrix world and it delivers spectacularly by combining observations on man 's fear of the unknown and of being usurped with politics , extensive religious and historical imagery , subverting expected portrayals of parties involved and an at least partially believable and thus terrifying vision of our near future .

maybe it 's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie.it 's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while .

then the fun begins as everyone about him also `` go down '' .just think jfk and all the people associated in any way with his assassination , who 's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you 'll appreciate what is implied in this film.i think it 's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred .
although this film is not for the masses ( as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism involved in the story ) i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story , the more sadness you feel .

i have n't seen anywhere near the majority of welles ' work yet , but i 've tended to like his later films better , when he became a bit more campy and performance-arty .
sharing conventions with the slasher genre , this is somewhat of a convention itself , and , in good ol ' slasher genre tradition , prison punishes those who have been bad.all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world .

this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarce.the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war waged with japan .

stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse !
reading it , i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it .
but other than that , this is top notch horror feeling , mixing sartre 's `` hell is other people '' with a lovecraft/barker type of story , and doing rather successfully.bottom line : take the time to watch this .

when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions , americans seemed sad , hurt , and a little remorseful but did n't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth .
) .none seems to have noticed that renaissance 's poster features a rourke look-alikethat guy is marv ; which does n't make it a sin city rip -- off , but not a paragon of originality either , and in fact there 's more resemblance to the miller talenamely , the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society , the brio of the hero ( in fact a cross of willis ' character and rourke 's persona in the previous movie

mgm , realizing the value of it 's newest 'star ' , knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original ... and tarzan and his mate delivered ! the film had an interesting back story ; cedric gibbons , mgm 's legendary art director , had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel , prior to the release of tarzan the ape man , despite the fact that he 'd never directed before ( the studio had n't anticipated the film 's impact , and did n't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty ' film ... and they wanted to keep their oscar-winning department chief happy ) .

those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i 've watched the stone angel .
still , after my recovery from the first shock , i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character , and i drew the conclusion that all the absurdities , cruelty , brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality , being emphasized by distorting it .
i felt it ended beautifully .
there is also the patchwork recollections of john 's wife ( sharon - played by lisa kudrow ) and his girlfriend ( dawn - played by kate bosworth ) that fill in the spaces between the two stories .
seriously , long 's performance was a total shock and really brilliant .

this is a good job too because other than the basic premise , the film does n't really have a 'plot ' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting .

in `` moonstruck '' , however , i think she was incredibly well suited to her role , and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation .

her depictions of interactions with the likes of calvin klein , jerry lewis , bianca jagger , ralph lauren and ( what we 're lead to believe is ) warren beatty are fictional and hilarious.sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment , performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of nina simone 's song `` four women '' while dressed in a mufti and other african garb , singing lines such as `` my skin is black , '' `` my hair is wooly , '' and `` they call me sweet thing .

the fact that other people 's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody , notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this movie.of course old-timers will be tempted to say : they do n't do movies like this one any more .

i felt like i was listening to a high school play.and the pancake make-up is way too heavy.and the sets do n't fully convey the gothic mood of the novel .
if you like road movies , murder , humor , and narration , watch this film .
the first hour plods along , and the dialogue feels very edited and a bit stagey - people wait for each other to finish and do n't always react in a natural cadence , which would be a problem of recording each individual 's dialogue separately .
i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked .

how was modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non-childhood .
as mysteries go , the narrative is rather ordinary : a simple diversion , one jealous husband as red herring.what 's rather miraculous is welles ' placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark , dark multifaceted world .
it 's one of those movies that could easily get by someone , but for romantic comedy `` moonstruck '' is really in a class by itself .
as a young teenager at the time , airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their `` cowboys and indians '' to have amazing gadgets and whizz-bang explosions.in many ways , the show was essentially knight rider in the skies : similar comic-book technology , a central character who was essentially a loner , and echoing the concept of one man making a difference.but in other , important ways , it was thematically very different from knight rider , street hawk , the a-team and other action shows of the time .
excellent script.further credits go to sutherland 's performance , which is superb and sympathetic , jeffrey demunn as the killer whom we despise but ca n't hate , and max von sydow , who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help .
excellent plot within a plot within a plot .
in `` the far country '' , stewart 's jeff webster , by not getting involved to help anyone else ( except himself ) , gets to see essentially the same thing : a world in which he ( for all practical matters ) does n't exist.by not getting involved ( and by attempting not to care about anyone ) , webster is forced to see those for whom he ca n't help but care get hurt , pushed around , and even killed while he stands by and does nothing .
things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching , and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone .
that certain thing is the story of a gold digger ( viola dana ) from a tenement house .
great softcore sex , revealing and sexy , and plenty of it .
i do n't see why lucile watson was nominated for best supporting actor , i just do n't think she did a very good job .
so stop bashing it please .
a chance in a million reversal saves the family , but it is so rare that we know it is just a dramatic trick .
the supporting cast ( nick , the ex-con boyfriend ; karen , her best friend ; and her life-controlling parents ) all added a great degree of believability .
it was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls ' innocence throughout the film , but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty .
if you are into martial art movies , you are going to love this one !
he was actually playing cello which was very impressive , and his lines were never forced .
eight months has passed ...
i rated it a 9 based other films of this genre and age .
the audience was therefore all the more appreciative of viewing `` zabriskie point '' in its original , breathtaking format , and broke into thunderous applause at the end .
it 's intriguing , like all peter weir 's stuff , but it 's not always as attention-holding as i would have liked .
the english version needs a tad bit of help in the dubbing department but it was still enjoyable .
my mom saw frank sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out .
this film is the second superlative canadian film i have seen within the past few weeks ( the first was `` the red violin '' ) , far better than all but the best hollywood efforts.gustad noble is anything but that ; he is a middle-aged parsi bank employee in bombay in the 1970s .
by the '90 's my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa 's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again.idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out , but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne .
take a look at the martian costumes next time .
the location was sylvan lake in the black hills .
my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while , and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard , blow off the dust and pop it in .
savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed.as to the performances , george macready is his usual creepy self , barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence .
everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing .
it was in 1950/51 in the korean war that gen. macarthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat .
i loved the effect used at the end ( and a little bit at the beginning ) of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie .
and duke ellington does n't hurt either.a must stroll down memory lane .
each such step was met with praise by liberals , who celebrated the warren court 's ill deeds with glossy covers on time and newsweek .
; ) ( if you have n't seen it yet , do , then you 'll understand that quote ! )
this is how movies are supposed to be made : a fascinating setting ; characters about whom you come to care deeply ; writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense .
this film is about the unlikely friendship between a businessman and a man with down syndrome.the character development in this film is excellent .
this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle .
rosamund oliver is in it ... she was completely cut out of the vhs .
cusack visited the iraq war earlier this year in the 180 degree different `` grace is gone '' and here he allows his political views wear on his sleeve ; while admirable overall the film 's pace and rhythms are off largely no-thanks to first time filmmaker joshua seftel making his directorial debut here ( and it is noticeable ) except for maybe the well-choreographed fight hauser is involved with babyyeah 's idiotic fiancé 's entourage.a nice attempt yet a misguided failure ; maybe next time cusack wo n't try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting by himself .
it remains the sum of its parts .
gerald soetman is a great writer .
aside of gob on arrested development , bridget may well be a shoe-in for any awards given to this archetype .
these scenes are perfectly directed , photographed and acted .
but still malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting .
the film 's title `` presque rien '' ( almost nothing ) points to all of these and , indeed , to one of the key scenes in the film : in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself , a psychiatrist asks cédric if he had ever cheated on him
ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion , sympathy and feelings about what happened .
it has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town .
the film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named 'gabe ' , who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole .
you can put your brain on pause , and just relax , and chuckle away.to ask for more , in my honest opinion , is asking too much .
nina simone comes to mind .
well , there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes , but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved .
which might one aver ? in documented history , artemisia gentileschi was subjected to the thumbscrew , and still affirmed that she was r***ed , as mary garrard and gloria steinem have eloquently affirmed.in the movie , under a different torture , she refused to condemn her lover/violator.how may a movie deviate so much from received history , yet still inform the human heart ? the answer is not so hard to find .
ignore the ignoramus who does n't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way .
the acting by a small cast is pretty good.and all through the house is n't the best tale from the crypt but it 's a decent one all the same , worth a watch but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this ?
the close-ups on the plane & the torpedo boat & how they were used were completely new to me .
this time , kermit , fozzie , miss piggy , scooter , rowlf , the electric mayhem , gonzo and camilla the chicken are out of college and starring in a musical that they 're trying to get on broadway .
`` panic '' is the story of a hit man , alex ( macy ) who actually works for his father ( sutherland ) .
one case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war `` why must we murder one another .
you never have to yell : '' no izumo , it 's a trap '' the guy already knows it he has that common sense .
i was deeply moved .
my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it .
has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema ?
it also explains that sho and son have become enemies.through tragedy after tragedy this movie dives into the reality of life and all it 's hardships , focusing on friendship and love .
when we first meet early in the beginning of the film , we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual .
but there are many other levels speaking here.the movie 's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of james cole ( bruce willis , doing the best work of his career here ) .
but i was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding .
maybe the one who said she 's boring is because he/she is boring .
does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal must 've caused ?
other notables in the cast are “ dr .
but we have never been asked to feel sorry for bettie page : her abusive childhood is quickly referenced and skipped over ; when she is raped by four hometown lads , we see only the threat and then bettie recovering and surviving , picking herself up in deserted woodland , and putting on the brave face of someone who refuses to lie down and die.although no nudity is involved , it 's bettie 's special interest photos that eventually arouse trouble .
there are many on the israeli side , both there and here in the us , who just want it all and will not consider peace .
eddie is so off the wall that i 've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now , and it still rocks every single time .
there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects .
he is every man .
overall , the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state .
maybe she was standing in the shadow of ms. theron .
but in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone .
tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks .
i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it 's a film that is very very very nice to see , alone or with someone .
as played by theresa russell , marilyn ( a closet intellectual in real life ) , lectures a childlike einstein ( 'the professor ' , played by emil ) on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight , while getting the professor to show off his legs , in conscious parody of her own role in the seven-year itch , the movie the actress is seen to be working on in the film 's opening.history records that monroe 's then-husband , fading baseball star dimaggio ( played by busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton ) , was unhappy about her iconic dress-splaying scene in the film , precipitating their break-up .
the far country is just the tiniest bit less , and it contains 99.9 % of what made that film so special without , of course , feeling like a cheap copy .
but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it .
i was amazed at her performance .
although i am not a big fan of 'southpark ' , parker and stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie .
so , it 's rocky viewing in places , but i 've seen and survived much worse.it would have been ok as the 3 short films but as a take on intolerance it 's inventive and funny from the start to the finish : in the stone age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus ; in the roman age buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging , no parking signs in latin ; in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump .
suddenly , they gaze at each other and , for one moment , we feel both their power and beauty , and the unstated -- except by the camera -- irony that in another time , another place , they perhaps could love each other and be married .
if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations , and get into the story , i think you will enjoy this , especially if you 've actually read the original h g wells novel .
i also thought that trymane was a good boss , firm but he got things done !
the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters , rather than being spoon-fed an opinion .
needless to say , it all ends well for everyone , and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good .
you 'll be laughing at their own view of heaven .
* we are reminded of the great crop of top flight movies that year , what with gone with the wind , mr.smith goes to washington , the citadel , juarez , the wizard of oz , of mice and men , one million b.c. , zenobia , we want our mummy all counted among the output that year .

his one big pussy .
? main characters : rex the tyrannosaurus rex , elsa the pterodactyl , dweeb the parasarolophus , ooo the triceratops , a boy called louis , a girl called cecilia and captain new-eyes .
on dvd .
by age 5 , i had watched it over 400 times .
i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7.5/10
but still having to deal with the rumours .
i 'd recommend this film to anyone .
but on its own , it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas ' later productions .
in every way , this film is meant to evoke your sense memories .
burns is just great tossing off one-liners with ease and even matthau was good matching him .
but , i can appreciate the scene play could n't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell.some have complained about hanks as a gangster .
usually , a detective story setting have proved too static and talkative to make convincing movies even though they work well enough on the printed page , but here michael curtiz 's direction and the fine editing give the film a pace and urgency that make it altogether different from similar films of its type
you 'll regret it !
rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life .
it 's been quite some time since i 've watched this lotr .
i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with oh mr porter .
hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop that 's being minted by hollywood today .
one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil .
they put together a crew and manage to get the original star , vanessa turnbill ( molly ringwald ) , to return to australia - in fact , to the original location - to complete hot blooded
one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made .
this film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to warners at the time .
dr. meyerling operates on virginia & it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success & virginia is pregnant .
it 's a yakuza/triad picture , involving cops versus japanese & /or chinese gangsters ( mostly chinese , as the title suggests ) , but already even in his first technical 'debut ' , takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here-on in .
time to end this review .
the shortcomings of the film 's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young brendan 's heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages .
her photos were mainly seen in and around new york , in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications .
funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief -- you have to see it to believe it .
the story focuses on a pair accused of murder that lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done .
yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain .
robert duvall and glenn close make the perfect stoic farm parents .
if only those possibilities had diminished today , but alas , they are getting worse every day .
do not underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one .
wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great wrestlemania 's but i would personally put it , in my top 5 , if not the top 3 .
spiritual harmony is the most important for love.excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.one of the best romance movies .
not only were the characters and actors right on , but these are a very talented set of actors .
the actors and the direction of this film are both good .
an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of southampton art gallery ( near where i live ) , but although i found these pieces intriguing , i only realised the wonder of goldsworthy 's work when i was lucky enough to catch a re-screening of rivers and tides.thomas reidelsheimer 's film , accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by fred frith , brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work .
the characters all develop a quirky charm , especially `` richard '' .
this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70's.daltrey shows what being a front-man is all about , entwistle steady as ever .
james cahill , god rest his soul , made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man .
guiness dashes out the open door.the following example would be unthinkable today .
as roger ebert has observed , the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition.later , during the avalanche sequence , one of the terrorists/thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain .
that is , the film not only has a heroic musical theme , but it also sports lyrics , yes , the legionairres sing !
filmed in the town of shrewsbury , england , it just seems somehow very british .
produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney , who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker .
also , one character says in the end that he will return , if japan films allows to make the sequel .
i saw it at an advanced screening , and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards .
it 's a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child , a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised .
conrad veidt , always a fun actor , makes a great villain , and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves , who at one point finds a genie in a bottle .
this film is highly recommended .
after having seen this film for the first time tonight , i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person 's day .
`` panic '' is a captivating , blurred-genre film about a brooding and conflicted middle aged hitman 's reconciliation of infatuation with a younger uninhibited hairstylist , his love of wife and son , his duty to his employer/father with his own identity .
remember the car that runs on water ?
it is marathi , and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence , does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half-witted designer ware .
carol 's family is obviously divided , while carol 's mother is married to someone that is an air force pilot with the leftist faction , the rest of the family 's sympathies are with the franco and the fascists that won the conflict.the story adds nothing to what has already been told , much better , but it 's an easy film to watch .
you will laugh , cry , laugh , then cry some more .
jj has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on t.v land .
it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much .
both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both , ultimately , show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency .
soldier is essentially an action movie , and the role of sergeant todd is an essential action hero .
the fight scene in the end could 've been a little longer and a little more violent , but what can you do ?
the script , while not oscar-worthy , has its funny and heart-warming parts , and should keep kids and adults entertained .
and the brunette actress has a single body , has one breast slightly bigger .
we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad ! the multi player , me and some of my friends agree , is very good and challenging , even if there are no bots .
no very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time.next match saw the light heavyweight title defended by champion taka michonoku against aguila .
some time ago .
the sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot , bearing a phrase first shown only in arabic , then with a translation added : `` does god 's light guide us or blind us ? ''
where were you at 8 o'clock this evening , asks inspector burgess ( thomas gomez ) ?
this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it 's kind .
us immigration would never allow such a thing to happen.wumaster - i got everything i wanted by going abroad !
many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling , buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins ' abilities to get at the truth ( ..perhaps poking fun at know-it-all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve it ) ..i felt he was used as comedy relief , particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims , often misunderstanding what are told to him .
it 's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil.this film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of anne , a raw recruit , into a police squad stationed in the baltic area .
the movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes , making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty , and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots , some of them are bound to hit .
i believe that heaton is in love with spike , but spike is too naive to see this.i really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences .
besides that , they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam , and many other popular space operas.for one , the shows starts out pretty light , with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting .
the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws , showing these dancers ' feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett .
most of that is due to the fact that lynch and writers john roach and mary sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part .
this short film is about a talking spatula named edward .
it scared the s**t out of me .
this was a local town council with a department who had the power to pass a film just for london , where it was deemed audiences were more `` sopisticated '' than those who lived out in the sticks.the film was duly submitted and passed .
not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary .
at first , it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis .
in a film named albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city , but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere .
do n't expect to find much here of the political life of italy in 1943 .
if you 've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry , this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing .
often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive , the entire set would obviously move.the best moments of the movie were the silent , more old fashioned , slapstick kind of moments .
he , too does an excellent job in this movie .
`` ca n't we go , doctor .
though derivative , `` labyrinth '' still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show .
i 've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role , the text , the dialogue , and rochester 's love for jane .
perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline .
the acting from branagh and bonham-carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role .
the final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged , but i would n't recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance .
but on the whole , the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures.some inventive staging for the dance numbers , including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors , more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number .
here it is.. the first ever episode of friends , where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar ( courtney cox ) , newly divorced ross gellar ( david schimmer ) , hippy pheobe buffay ( lisa kudrow ) , unknown actor and ladies man ( matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing ( matthew perry ) .
his performance is excellent because it 's so modulated .
this is only one example of how my grief was disrespected !
i was pretty young when this came out in the us , but i recorded it from tv and watched it over and over again until i had the whole thing memorized .
) under odd circumstances ( firing at his werewolf son inside a metallic bomb shelter is n't a very good idea , especially if the bullet does n't leave the room and bounces around like a pinball gone berserk ) , tony travels the land through endless years , until he 's tired of packing , and returns decades ( ..and many us presidents ) later to hopefully lead his football team to a win over simpson..a task he abandoned long ago .
strongly recommended , 9/10 .
i like the attitude too !
an aunty of mine who lives in the usa and is a lecturer at the columbus uni ohio had done a paper on the effects of the british army in ni .
with songs like the beach boys ' `` good vibrations '' playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie , he creates an offbeat , yet astoundingly `` right '' feel .
even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted.there are numerous small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable , it has a few `` devices '' that pop up and add another hilarious layer .
i believe that this is an extraordinary movie .
personally i think it 's a great movie .
after moving in , the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation ...
my only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses i 've ever seen -- but these are mild complaints.a very good thriller .
i am haunted by waters . ''
he called jerry , his butler , `alfred ' .
the real gem to be found here , though , is the performance of young anthony walters as tiny tim ; it 's heartfelt without ever becoming maudlin , and simply one of the best interpretations -- and the most real -- ever presented on film.the excellent supporting cast includes roger rees ( fred holywell , and also the narrator of the film ) , caroline langrishe ( janet holywell ) , lucy gutteridge ( belle ) , michael gough ( mr. poole ) and joanne whalley ( fan ) .
i did n't want to open old wounds .
sidney lumet has , throughout his career , consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting : naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time .
!
and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont , who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience !
i 'll be looking forward to more of sean and corinne 's involvement in the movie entertainment industry .
( i say , i think , very . )
a slightly miscast james mason leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that spirals into a full-blown generational conflict , then a pleasingly schmaltzy resolution .
it 's also pretty sexy , with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes .
the local doctor treats carefully the blister , and asks steve to investigate the location where they found the old man .
- ( do they outweigh those of the criminal ?
the three are taken to a friend 's farm when their family goes away .
kusturica 's 'everything but not subtle ' take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop .
the movie is beautiful to watch .
the pacing is done very well for those that like to think -- enough is kept hidden from the viewer early on , and questions keep arising which are later answered , producing a well-thought out and very satisfying film , both cerebrally and from an action standpoint.it seems some people were looking for a non-stop roller-coaster ride with this film -- one of those that comes charging out of the gate .
strange comics .
members of the congregation would invite `` unsaved '' friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week .
the roles each character played were done with excellence.the lyrics , the words , every gesture , the sunrise , told it all.the movie spoke to me .
they 're survivors .
hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0 ... . no i 'm totally joking ill give it a 9 hope you understand that you will laugh , you will scream and you may just be offended.love yours truly : dakota you can email me at dakota_loves_it @ hot mail.com if you wan na
this film plays really well with an audience .
dutch films are different but still enjoyable .
i give it an 8/10 .
great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano .
i loved it , you will too , whatever your feelings are .
in this particular scene martino has the killer hack through the door with a knife in a manner influenced by dario argento 's crystal plumage , however , it also has the killer attempt to flick the latch open with the blade of a knife which is something repeated later by argento in suspiria .
stewart playing against type , plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge , an emotion that he would carry into future films with mann .
to his surprise , manuel tur , one of his boyhood friends is also being treated , and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care .
if you are not a huge woody the actor fan , fear not .
*** outta ****
this is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of manawaka , condemning the young couple to a life of poverty.going through the motions of her marriage to bram , hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town 's upper classes .
the best movie i 've seen in years .
at least i did !
do n't like it , do n't watch it .
i do n't mind that it does n't seem to align perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and let 's face it , they are two different shows .
batman and superman .
with an authentic looking time period , cinematography worth an oscar and clips of the real life homer and friends at the end , whom all hit it big with their dreams , especially homer , this is the first great film of 1999 .
i ca n't believe john died !
have a great ( probably r-rated ) laugh , and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper .
the guy who plays lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either .
the version i 'm reviewing is the 2003 american dub ( i know , sacrilege for a hard-core anime fan to not watch it in its native language ) ; there is at least one other english language dub out there , i have it on vhs ( i have no idea from what source ) , and that version is the single best dub i have ever encountered of any film .
the two of them make out in the luncheonette , but she decides that they must break up .
ollie , hatless , in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down , and the butler jessup ( sam adams ) is covered in chimney ash smoke , oh , and ollie still has nothing to say to stan .
with so much violent intent directed at insp .
this film is sarno classic .
i do n't intend to do a summary of this excellent movie , just go see it if you have the chance .
i was that age , but have no idea what i myself looked like then .
since gene kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in `singin ' in the rain ' , then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at mgm .
michael myers is one scary , evil guy .
the ending is excellent , and the hospital scene near the end is absolutely terrifying , plus the end twist shocked the hell out of me ! .
this movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it - you can have it .
there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage , barbara stanwyck , `` do n't go away '' .
i highly recommend this movie for everyone .
he is obviously very talented , but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he sabotages it , usually in the most dramatic way possible .
perhaps there could be a follow up series called `` the century at war '' for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors .
the film is wonderfully directed by lewis milestone ( who also produced ) ; the whole production feels like a labor of love .
the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum ( joey ) , lilia skala ( dr. littauer ) , j.t .
i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since .
or maybe just drive him mad ?
i 'd been waiting for this since before they started filming .
maria conchita alonso , does well here , she was really cute , and had good chemistry with arnie ! .
perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton .
altman says he consulted `` the night of the hunter '' for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to `` spread his wings and try a popcorn picture '' , but what he 's secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the southern gothic genre.so instead of a showdown on small boat , we get a showdown on a giant ship .
the lover was finally able to reconcile his real-life situation with his fantasy of loving only me.i thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in chris 's mind .
'nuff said .
as the lovers conduct a not-so-secret affair at sea , arthur bannister 's partner in his law firm , george grisby ( glenn anders ) comes aboard .
, but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair.moving along , a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi , while another has completely lost her husband emotionally , sexually , intellectually , but not physically .
flynn , known mostly for his swashbuckling roles ( and his bedroom antics ! )
along this whacked-out voyage , they play board games with none other than death ( william sadler , from die hard 2 ) , reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal , aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more.bogus journey 's array of exuberant special effects gimmicks are n't up to to-date standards , and even some of the humor and the for-the-time look and feel are somewhat dated ( to be honest , the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year , even for the 90 's ) .
in short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive
like the inspector , his personality was exaggerated.well , that 's pretty much all i have to say about this movie .
ralph sall 's score adds to the movie 's suspense , but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame .
during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds , a giant spider that 's really hungry , and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.-this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses , genies , flying carpets , and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs .
i had seen 'kalifornia ' before ( must be about 10 years ago ) and i still remember to be very impressed by it .
it is interesting to note that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon .
part of her charm  and respect from the fans  lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous ( unlike many other big name actors & actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their `` early '' work ) .
i 'll organise one and the guests shall be ..
from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question whats next ?
having seen this film i might have to agree .
not one of grant 's nor loy 's best films , they make an outstanding effort together .
this is a ghost story , and these are the voices of ghosts - many of them petiot 's future victims.yet petiot himself is often only a voice ; his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera , throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody .
the human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies , because it translates personal , subjective opinions on war , opposed war action movies where action , and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor .
!
it is a very foggy night ( the type of pea soup fog that london was known for up until a notorious `` killer '' fog in the 1950s ) , and the crowd ( who 'd been attending a party in the hotel ) need beds .
`` the garden of allah '' will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography .
the cast are all very good and they play their roles very well , the story is simple and predictable , but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny.a great family movie 8/10
this turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in us history with the us forces losing a record , in the korean war , 1,000 lives on the very first day-nov. 29/30 1950-of the communist chinese invasion ! shocked and humiliated in what he allowed , due mostly to his own arrogance , to happened macarthur went on the offensive not against the advancing communist chinese and noth koreans forces but his own commander and chief pres .

he 's deemed immature by the other girls .
antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece , this time on the other side of the atlantic than `` blow up '' .
the first was good and original .
i showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club , and they were kept spellbound until the ending !
helena did an amazing job in it !
it definitely seemed like all of the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters were in i most definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10 .
but this is common knowledge ; i think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time , failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur .
you must see it !
i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture .
after han has been rescued , and jabba defeated , luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth ; darth vader is in fact his father .
she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it .
for example , she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point `` i need someone to sleep with '' .
it reminded me that no matter what horrible things i say to my dad , i do n't mean them and it 's very important that he knows this .

jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force .
that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield .
this was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year .
jefferson jr. , tony swartz , terry carter , lloyd bridges , jack stauffer .
most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of favor and his men .
add to this that the slow-burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that 's ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film .
todd is withdrawn , uncommunicative and a loner .
the real tragedy is that the cia 's 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave ayatollah khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the koran to establish a chauvinistic society , and that george w. bush 's current policy towards iran gives mahmoud ahmadinejad an excuse to act the cowboy and tighten censorship.above all , this is a neat look at people coming up with ways to challenge the system .
so sad that it 's gone .
he is one of the great actors of our time.and cindy burbridge , ex miss thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady , even doing an english accent with remarkable success .
the narrative driven , and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series ' and this bold move by the league really pays off .
hollywood should learn more from korean productions .
to start off with , since this movie is a remake of a classic , the rating has to be lowered already .
i can see why people might not like the movie ; however , i can not understand people saying it is boring .
jodie sweetin plays steph the love able middle child who feels left out .
good everything .
it 's a shame that in greece did n't work commercially , in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like politiki kouzina..
although i did n't really notice the score , it must have been okay , or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment.overall , wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions , as long as you do n't mind having to think about the movies you watch .
guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks , in both the uk & the us .
budget considerations , coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies , influenced the decision to use older footage.although completely new films were still being made by the stooges , most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in .
the rear screen is often very obvious , there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing .
and `` père-lachaise '' that even though i love the acting , i felt it 's themes were forced .
the ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically , but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film .
`` beware the concussion , you have been warned !
when these addicts and their families share their lives with me , they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family.the show , unlike many others , digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction .
despite how this is a fictionalized movie , one can not help but notice the obvious similarities to columbine .
maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy .
during the romantic interlude at the beginning with fonda and pauline moore who played ann rutledge the music in the background is the same theme used in the man who shot liberty valance for vera miles .
benkei is even more hampered here by the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world , even when not in open conflict he is never at ease .
***** out of 5
in my opinion , `` the gay sisters '' is a much better film - better made in all departments , and more interesting , complex and enjoyable .
the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story .
as such , it was successful although i liked it too .
the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background .
kazan 's early film noir won an oscar .
soon , there was a rumor of a doc savage movie !
you either love it or you hate it , and not everyone will like this movie .
i was so sad they took the show off air ... at least we still have the re-runs ! !
she is even willing to take a bath .
on the whole , i come out of this movie knowing a few more things about herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when i come in to the theater .
i guess i 'm writing this because i feel that if you 're going to adapt a novel , adapt it , but do n't make it something else that it 's not .
martin sheen is excellent , and though nick nolte has a small part , he too provides excellent support .
he thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting .
and he has teeth .
there are two hardcore stars in it , lauen montgomery and venus .
the cities of madrid and lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories , and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters .
it is good .
janice rule is perfect as the snobby ex-college rival of gillian , now dating stewart , and ernie kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric who is writing the definitive book on witches .
years ago i was lucky enough to have seen this gem at a > gypsy film festival in santa monica .
without the mark you ca n't sell or buy , with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it .
old person 2 : ai n't you dead yet ?
it was really very good .
they are human beings seeking a return to a familiar , non-manufactured existence that is beyond the normalcy they experience everyday .
as much as possible is conveyed by imagery , and hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip-read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters ' speech .
you know the rest of the story anyway , do n't you ?
it 's original , and thought provoking .
whatever the case , the situations change with a fast speed and tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance .
this show is probably one the best i 've seen , it 's funny , heartwarming , touchy , and nice .
however the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots ( the animosity between harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums , a mob vendetta against him ) take up too much screen time and do n't really have any bearing to the larger story .
physically and emotionally speaking , redgrave is acting in a box .
tony curtis and rock hudson , teen heartthrobs in later years , have brief but good roles .
the movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of hickok and smith .
well , well you 'll see : we 've written directed and produced : i know where i 'm going , colonel blimp , red shoes
the funniest of all , however , has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue captain amazing .
i remember this scene in the theater .
here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes .
i started this film thinking `` oh , i get it - indie comedy - off the wall - gonzo ... yup . ''
the list goes on and on.being that these are dreams i suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices , but they 're so out of left field that there 's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience .
of course , falk , robert culp , and ray milland are the highest-quality actors and it 's a pleasure to see them work -- all men are familiar from many other roles yet lose themselves in their characters here .
the dialogue is sparse but telling , and the nonverbal acting is outstanding .
it only blossomed when they kissed each other .
and if you want them willing to pull strings , make calls , and get a work of art removed - let them discover that truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouths.the aardman folks have always been way ahead of the curve .
i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining .
this does n't take away from the overall experience however .
it is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer.all in all , this was a treat .
now , batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line.the animation is the sleeker , futuristic style that was utilized for batman : the animated series ' fifth and sixth seasons ( aka the new batman adventures ) .
this is a graphic movie .
the only one that seems normal is lauren bacall , who was n't asked to make her lucy moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught hanging out with the wrong crowd.together with his other hollywood movies , `` written on the wind '' shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see : stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen
there is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of dooley 's wife that do n't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences , dog poop jokes , fart jokes , and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area .
the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named `` la jetée '' ( 1962 ) which i have n't seen , but i must thank the director and writer of the movie , chris marker , for giving such an inspiration for the writers of `` twelve monkeys '' .
snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with `` five . ''
director-writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock-imitation ( many called it a `` ripoff '' ) with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work ( and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-tv tapes ) .the downside of the movie , at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard , is the general sleaziness of all the characters , including the policeman played by a pre-nypd dennis franz ( who has hair here ! ) .
it may be an easy target , but they pull it off none the less .
it is released in sleep , a bad dream come to corporeal existence .
everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form , maybe not directly funny , but the situation and the delivery are what counts.if you liked jesus is magic then i do n't see how you would n't like this .
the total absence of bathos left me open mouthed .
tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls .
it is somewhat odd that karloff , who was in fact british , plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi , who was hungarian , plays a french scientist , but they are both excellent as usual .
the lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer , the powerful cinematography of the events ( which normally does n't amount to much in horror films ) , and the beauty of jamie lee curtis is exactly what makes halloween that film above the rest .
regardless , the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position , which is noticeably primitive .
the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere , and there is a good deal of tension throughout .
took account of her emotions and actually has made a commitment to re-up for another 6 years .
by the time i had gotten to this fourth and final story , it was after 3 am and i could n't quite stay awake on the first try ( not from boredom ) .
think of `` lord of the rings '' or `` neverending story '' for japan .
kasdan underscores this theme lightly , rather than insisting on it , and bolsters it in various ways , most memorably by the device , right in the center of the film , of having mac and his wife , lying in bed , each dreaming their own dreams , but as well showing , later on in the film , how those dreams have the power , within the film , to shape reality .
and , a great deal of the elusive dialogue does n't help matters .
i would really appreciate it alot !
netflix has it and the dvd video and sound quality are excellent .
but if you stick around , you might learn something .
blandings , a new york ad executive , decides to move his family to the connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there .
wow !
claire denis has to be my favorite french director at this point , better than leos carax even .
but still all around a great high paced action movie .
* kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey 's sexuality in her interview with lucy liu.if you find this film a bit far fetched , then check out domino harvey , as the facts are more amazing than the fiction .
yelli , the camp owner and manager of orna & ella '' , a hip cafe , rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the crap that surrounds them '' .
people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives .
james `` not jim '' belushi , a hammy kid actress , and a cheesy title in a john hughes formula .
another notable presence is nana patekar , who plays narsimha , the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar .
the pair live off their wits as they travel the great us of a .
can mr. brooks survive on his own without the luxuries of being filthy rich ?
the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk .
memories of the superfriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast .
i highly recommend this serial .
i 've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is jack o'neill , the not-only-smart samantha carter , the glorious teal'c , women and kids favorite , and brilliant dr. daniel jackson.of course , stories sometimes not serious , sometimes even ridiculous , but mostly it 's not about technology or space fighting - it 's about helping your friend , even risking your life for him .
he did n't seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation .
( albeit sleepwalkers , if i 'm understood right , is a script without any novel or short story behind it ) .
marching unopposed into austria in 1938 , hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering germany and czechoslovakia called sudetenland .
it 's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences , so do n't slam a classic if you have n't given it a chance .
the cruise also contains bannister 's sinister partner george grisby ( glenn anders ) and one sidney broome ( ted de corsia ) who turns out to be a detective hired by bannister to watch elsa .
decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between bertille noel- bruneau , and the multiple foxes that played renard .
such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical americans for the future ! !
whenever elmer catches him in his bed .
a damsel in distress is a delight because of the great gershwin songs , fred astaire , joan fontaine , and a terrific supporting cast headed by gracie allen and george burns.typically silly plot for an astaire film has him as an american dance star in england with burns as his publicist and allen his secretary .
not so with this one .
the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once , as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives .
this is quite an impressive cast , and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce.these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old b-movies .
in this case , the contrast between alicia 's rage and deanna 's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat .
clive owen was practically an afterthought .
i did n't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it , and it really does n't on a very obvious level , so if you 're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours , i would n't worry about it .
the father and son in the car ) especially sad , kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it 's one of his paintings .
hopper does what he does best , playing a psycho known as `` lyle from dallas , '' the real hit man .
**** out of 4 stars
hidden frontiers-is more than fan fiction- it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of star trek alive and growing .
seems sweet , honest , nice ... just like she is in real life .
the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.the union procedures are quite droll , very reminiscent of i 'm all right jack ; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness ' character .
rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'the one ' ... i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband.jack and rose have a connection that is 'movie stuff ' but it 's good movie stuff .
charlton heston stars as thorne , an nypd detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive ( joseph cotten ) .
they can not get on all the time , they are both forgetful , especially during conversation , but they do it eventually .
it 's like watching a movie and getting a laurel & hardy short with it for free .
vanessa redgrave plays anne grant lord , a woman sun-setting out of life .
what makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place ; the soviet union in the 1980 's .
same stuff that make 'plan 9 from outer space ' cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it .
it 's been my favourite movie since it came out .
andrews and tierney are reunited with director preminger in a film noir that is as effective as `` laura , '' their earlier collaboration .
director anna broinowski appears increasingly on camera as her film progresses , and increasingly exasperated to boot ; but she is finally rewarded with a remarkable , although scary and disturbing , tale to tell - and one of those films that reminds us what a thoroughly weird world it is we live in .
no matter how cheesy it can be , it 's still a great show , and i would definitely recommend it to anyone.10/10
humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick , but lukas is transcendent as kurt .
not a film for the speeding-vehicle-and-explosion crowd , but grown-up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears .
i recommend this movie !
zombie bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre .
what happened to them ?
here , taylor gives yet another credible performance .
the songs in the film are `` together again '' , `` look at me , here i am '' , `` saying goodbye '' , `` and i 'm going to always love you '' , `` rat jazz '' and `` he 'll make me happy '' .
i 'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler , but i 'm playing it safe , so do n't read this if you have n't seen the movie.i adore this movie , and so does everyone i work with -- and that is the point .
earlier dickens novels are as long as bleak house , but are not nearly so intricately plotted .
i think it would be very interesting to see a modern update on this some how , perhaps a revisionist take on it , where people on the streets of compton break into happy songs about their horrible lives .
trey parker and matt stone play their roles as losers with apt perfection .
wallace holds back from using his powers ; wilder wants to go public on national tv.complicating the matter , wilder wants wallace 's wife , whom they both dated years earlier .
etc . )
i liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece .
soles , and the battle that she and her fellow students at vince lombardi high wage against their new repressive principal , miss togar .
he plays robert thorn , a detective in 2022 new york .
at first , her attitudes and behaviors do n't make much sense .
a featherweight plot and dubious characterizations do n't make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is .
first of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities .
she comes from an important old family , where ancient customs are still practiced .
a couple more characters are introduced , and parts of noriko 's past are dragged up again .
everyone is surely familiar with this most famous of stories  a heartless businessman is visited by the ghost of his dead partner on christmas eve and warned that if he continues in his uncaring ways then he will be doomed to an afterlife in chains .
at least , there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way , if we can call it that way.parker posey makes an amazing mary .
we do boil down to a fitting , if highly predictable , ending and overall i have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended .
embarrassingly , i just watched this movie for the first time , 13 years after its release .
come on guys grow up.when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy , fans could n't do anything , only watch and sap it all up anyway .
court proceedings follow.this romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending .
miss price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life .
both of these men are divorced , felix 's wife is nearby , while oscar 's is on the other side of the u.s. ( the west coast ) .
i love the red-neck rampage to get the aliens , the bug on the hood , the dod , the heat seeking populous annihilator , the mine field , the red camo , breaking the speed limit by 1800mph !
sure it 's fun seeing heavy arms attack tanks , ms , and planes the first time .
what makes 'yellow emanuelle ' so good is it 's leading heroine , the beautiful and exotic chai lee .
regal and taylor then grab london and suplex him face-first into the ladder !
peter o'donnell is listed in the credits as `` creative consultant '' and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years { although the events have been recast to modern days ) .
however , i bought it with some trepidation , because i hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a `` collectible '' gathering dust until the day i died .
it has been so many years since i saw this but i do feel compelled to defend this gem against those who lambast it.it is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinion here .
i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling , determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the ins , known as carl kolchak .
nearly fifteen years after he first appeared .
its not just about entertainment .
but 'victoria ' is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson .
she wants - even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue .
yes .
i strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of , but uncomfortable around transvestites .
that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972 .
when sis ' wedding is scheduled for the same day as the ultimate soccer match , what 's a girl to do ?
of course , each of the actors is the star of his or her own production , only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor 's personal films .
best of show : shohei imamura 's amazing final segment , which contemporary critics such as the thick-witted mick lasalle somehow misinterpreted as an attack on 'the terrorists ' , but now stands revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic ; samira makhmalbaf 's opening piece that manages to blend deep empathy for the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for the children of afghanistan ; and idrissa ouedraogo 's amusing children 's crusade for osama bin laden -- a hunt almost as serious and successful an undertaking as the one for the real osama .
when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie , but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance .
simple , yet deep , you will want to watch it again and again .
very unique story is about a famous actress ( theresa russell ) who after a hard nights work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor ( michael emil ) and together in his hotel room they talk .
the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films , but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people , the late silent feature in which he co-starred with marion davies .
it 's good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only `` based upon actual events , '' for a docudrama this ai n't .
lucas buck though lacking any conscience often works by , as he says , giving people enough rope to hang themselves with .
you can not go wrong with meg ryan 's cute perkiness combined with albert einstein 's genius .
the woman in black was a british made for tv movie which was first broadcast on the bbc on christmave eve of '89 , and again in '92 .
fleisher really knows how to fill the screen , and the cinematoraphy , writing , music used , and everything about it works .
but he reaches a new low when herr lommel works in footage from nearly his entire film catalog .
his direction is as great as it ever was , with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect .
maybe this is n't a movie for you .
that 's way too funny .
meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture .
10/10
look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper , because oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling-ball .
unfortunately , the model work , representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways , is laughably bad and could have been done much better , even with 30s technology .
is an insect , the walking stick.there are two dogs discussing odors and smells , while sniffing the behind of a poodle , as they talk about the different smells of a woman.there are two birds in a cage .
and second of all , this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore .
the last 25 minutes have a load of energy , visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys- , that really ... there 's no possible match .
the one-liners are the best .
wells was confident they would in the future , history would n't quite have turned out the way it did in things to come .
enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero .
first is his use of space .
it is fitting on a musical sunday to get your heart a pumping , and no one can do that better than little richard .
we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives .
the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way , connect the people and the pigs that travel together .
it is a sad day for all of us .
you may like it , you may hate it , but this is not just another kusturica poetic  balkanic dreamlike stuff .
the movie concept is more that interesting ... connecting the storytelling with real life events ... keeping us aware of everything..from facts to emotions !
the most moving scene , was willie finding out about zak 's death , and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina .
both churches are at fault here , the catholic church for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it and the protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fight .
well , easy mistake.i stand by the comments tho'.and spring and port wine is so very similar to the family way.when you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days , you really had something to say and talk about afterwards , something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development.theatrical experiences are almost real , and they are important in helping young people to grow up.it does n't happen now , i think , that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did .
actingwise daisuke ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as benkei , while tadanobu asano has a driven , cold arrogance as prince shanao .
what _a guy thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i 've seen in a long time , so if you do n't the main plotline , you 've still got something to make you smile.whether we 're talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen , like larry miller ( pretty woman , best in show ) , james brolin ( traffic ) , julie hagerty ( airplane !
especially good is the set representing the new york city subways and widmark 's shack near the river .
de mille ) , or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonetheless.scorcese does n't necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either ( orson welles and alfred hitchcock , two of scorcese 's biggest influences , are only mentioned in passing ) .
the story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old japanese play , and it plays itself out as such , combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept , an amazing narrative , and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore .
i ca n't believe this film is so difficult to find -- i 'd buy it on dvd in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet .

if lars van trier has put denmark on the offbeat-oddball dogma cinematic map in recent years , there is now a good chance that veteran maverick erik clausen ( 62 ) and his capable crew of actors will soon show the world that denmark has more to offer than dogmatic drivel , which is to say , a mass audience pleaser for young and old alike .

macy loves his own son , played beautifully by david dorfman ( `` the ring '' ) .
on the other hand , maybe the did just meet -- -like romeo and juliet.in brief : good performances , too short .
it works very well -- the film looks gritty ( as it should ) and uncomfortably realistic.farrell successfully covers up his irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing southern accent .
panaghoy sa suba is very good -- it has the drama , the action , the romance , and scene that will make you laugh.while the story is not that original ( a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love , japanese occupation , rebellion , american as lord ) , its presentation is something cool , especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the filipino , nipongo for the japanese and english for the american.this movie will go as one of this year 's best pinoy movies.go watch this !
holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world ( some 2 million children are trafficked every year ) and does so sensitively and without manipulation -- a tall order that the team at priority films does with great success .
this is a funny film .
i saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white , educated , and urban .
meaning if they where going for action was it action pact .
some of the most ravishing early technicolor , a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu , the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well .
if you want a light touch of fun , you should definitely watch g-girl 's and average matt 's adventures , especially to cheer up your partner .
now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc , he probably has great opportunity to do his studies .

that many of the people i knew felt at that time .
yes , i went and picked up the soundtrack from tower 's .
while rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities , it could be argued that dominick and eugene holds more valuable lessons for society .
everyone wanted to see this movie , which was not much more than a extended music video .
of the elements that make this the best at this point , i have to say # 1 is christine mcintire .
you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie .
now she has no idea what the hell is going on , only that a bunch of armed-to-the-teeth people apparently want her dead ... and she 's going to die not even knowing why.god , i hear the whining all the time .
but that was soo incredibly cheesy , it nocked off 2 points from the full 10.secondly , another cheesy moment , not as bad as the first , but when green arrow sais `` let 's go save the world '' .
what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure.anton newcombe , the main man of brian jonestown massacre , is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues , his friends and rivals the dandy warhols , but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him .
executive no.2 'but does he really suit the role ?
the may-december relationship between kelly 's character and nina 's reminded me of the same `` kept man '' relationship seen between george peppard and patricia neal in breakfast at tiffany's.there are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than singin ' in the rain .
zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect .
john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie !
dame margaret rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with pimlico .
though all three films frightened me , it was castle of blood that had the most profound impact.it was the first on the bill .
instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights , voguing allowed people to `` fight '' within the confines of everything short of touching each other ( which would warrant an automatic disqualification ) .

they 've got everything in here , from pointing the bone to the dream time , a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real .
his second try is this movie , got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office .
it seems so quiet ; especially at night when you only hear the animals .
done in the best simple elegant manner by fred astaire , it 's one of those songs that will endure as long as london endures and even after.overlooking the young and inexperienced joan fontaine , a damsel in distress rates as a classic , classic score , classic dancing , classic comedy .
eventually he goes into therapy in a nearby clinic and works with a therapist , eileen ( fiona shaw ) at home .
like every tale , it has some short of morality .

this was a wonderful film .
so if you do have a chance to see fido , take it , i promise some good laughs.9/10
`` paris is burning '' is one of the most humane , and one of the saddest , movies i 've ever seen .
either that or the general public is too interested in the tv vomit that is big brother .
you can tell this was aimed at younger boys .
ca n't comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers , there are some surprises in this film which even the seasoned film buff will be caught off guard by .
however , much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan 's awful script , because ( as i remember ) valette 's direction was n't the worst part about the film ( unless he chose to include the baby ) .
having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew , he does n't have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity .

( the sidekick of dj ) but the kids are wonderful too .
the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair .
as others have said , there is much to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen releases.much of the credit must go to chris gerolmo , whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in , until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved .
it was also interesting to see a different culture - a vanishing one at that .
in the beginning it 's perhaps a little bit slow of pace , but it really grabs you as the story unfolds .
cut .
his understanding of water , time , stone , change , and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar .
we see michael walk out of a building , then get shot at by thousands of troops .
well if that 's the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for you.in sophie fiennes ( sister of ralph & joseph if you were wondering ) has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive ( and often outrageous ) takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing , probing , and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings , socioeconomic , political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging , determined and near-frenetic dissertations .
i think you will too .
harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago .
a dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting .
he thinks about it 20 years later , `` if only i 'd hit that ball '' and how his life would be better because of it .
sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit , but she moved to the states recently ... or has she ?
all i can think is , if you can see a bug 's life and not feel anything at all , then you must have never made a big mistake , hurt your friends , had a crush , fallen in love , been frustrated that no one would listen to you , lied to someone you care about , felt like a social misfit , gotten excited over a new idea , come up with a great idea , had what you thought was a great idea backfire , been awkward one moment and confident the next , felt the pressure of responsibility , stood up for yourself and your loved ones , stood alone against the crowd , felt like a failure , felt like a big success , felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others ... well , you get the point .
there is a naturalism - a credibility , if you will - in our song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre , including american graffiti and cooley high.much of the credit for the film 's spirit goes to its principle actors .
it is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is , and was always intended to be , a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people .
the 700 club gives a great perspective on world events .
its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gon na be just fine in the end .
his father genma , you would think the father character would blend in to the background right ?
it is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this.about europa itself , i 'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong .
i wish there were more films like this .
the sea and the sky are strikingly blue , the islands green and untouched .
the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained , but the execution is fine , even building up strong suspense.charlie cox plays tristan , who falls for the wrong girl ( sienna miller ) , and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes .
it was a lovely introduction to her role of sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the austrian empress .
so it 's not the first one , nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place .
but having all that money , he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away , while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer .
i personally like to laugh , and love movies that make me to , be they comedies or horror flicks .
when i saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s , i was in awe of this film .
i would fill my head with books on magic and mystery , from timothy leary to aleister crowley .
perhaps his greatest legacy is that there 's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including richard dawkins consider it a near certainty .
while a pleasant enough musical , what stuck with me about this movie was the unexpected comedic chemistry between basil rathbone , as the has-been composer , and oscar levant as his assistant .
the ( real ) home videos of al as a kid are great , and the commentary from his ( real life ) parents gives a nice glimpse of just how weird al wound up as screwed up as he is .
no split involved in his award.the movie and the story by liam o'flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army .
still i was never bored .
soon , things come to a head , in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories , but can only be contained , up to a point , by miike and his crew .
as in chadha 's `` bride and prejudice , '' the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that ca n't be neatly slotted into the stodgy , sweet valley high categories of `` best friends '' or `` sisters . ''
this is capped off by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics john norman 's style toward the end.kristofferson , on the other hand , gives a superb performance throughout , managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love , pride and resentment toward esther .
but rank and privilege merit no special consideration .
first is 'the argentine , ' depicting che 's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of havana in the late 50 's , and the second is 'guerrilla , ' and concerns che 's failed effort nearly a decade later in bolivia to spearhead a revolution , a fruitful mission that led to guevara 's capture and execution in 1967 .
really enjoyed this little movie .
in an era of such awful cartoons , i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies.this movie does contradict the first .
all the story lines are so good !
a real masterpiece , that !
i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution , with elton john and ringo starr .
nor is it a poor attempt to be so .
and also , matt has the good luck to saddle himself with two lovely female detectives as sidekicks , frankie adams , played by mary castle , and her replacement , margaret `` jonesy '' jones , by kristine miller .
'how she move . '
robot jox tries hard , but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together -- robot against robot , man against man , man against woman .
my favorite parts were the fact that 1/jesus was blond , 2/the last supper was a huge meal,3/ he liked playing with the children,4/his death was for all people and for all time.the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting , but it touched my heart at that time .
in fact , i ca n't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role .
we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience .
being somewhat open-minded , i would not rule out the possibility of a conspiracy .
even so , schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness .
you see things , and you hear things , and you feel things , that you till the day you die will hope have never happened for real .
there is still good people in this world and ben 's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need .
we suspect if she 's being real ; the rest of the characters suspect too.there is the writer , sarah ( joan blondell ) , who ca n't understand why myrtle does n't understand the character she 's written for her .
in this movie , you can actually see several big names on the rise , linda hamilton and courteney cox namely ; caine 's was already big of course .
take mr. matuschek for example : when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself .
the women were easy and the men indulged in their favorite pastime : war , the only recreation of kings which the people could enjoy . ''
when i watched the eye , i was kind of disappointed about this two guys , who i had heard good words about them before .
.
after listening for a while , i turned off the sound and simply watched : much better !
this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see .
it has one of the most intensely violent scenes i have ever seen in a movie .
for anyone even remotely interested in american films , or cinema in general .
a police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about .
the beginning of the movie is set up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and pukes at almost anything .
gypo nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend in order to take a trip with his gal to america and a new way of living .
the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is n't half bad .
there are enough dramatic , humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs .
thanks .
costumes and settings are brilliant ; especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built .
not here .
but , properly compared with other independent movies , this film is perfectly acceptable .
10/10
so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies .
i highly recommend it .
before she went into politics or public service , glenda jackson was one of britain 's finest film actresses .
`` elvira , mistress of the dark '' is full of cute , gross , bawdy , and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags , puns , props , songs , and parodies .
just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so .
in this one cash and his police lt. buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a nazi criminal , a philanthropic witch , and a family of screw-ups and their wierdo helpers .
yes , a bug 's life was the originator of animated outtakes from pixar , a tradition that has continued on .
he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong .
have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse ?
cool .
well .
this film tells the story of coup/conspiracy by venezuela 's elite , the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments , to remove democratically elected president chavez , and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship .
leboeuf does a pretty good job , as do the other cast members : sigourney weaver , jon voight , tim blake nelson , henry winkler , patricia arquette , and eartha kitt .
when denzel was trying to hook his brother up on the job , reminds me of my teen ages when my brother was always mad with me about getting myself busy all the time .
to make matters even more complicated , the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard .
for the most part , they are competent , not bad , but not outstanding .
i was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who , after i convinced them i was not the typical american male , taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country .
you are probably already familiar with the `` f.u . ''
the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie , the new ones are quite good ones , and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion , especially compared to a musical which has few decors .
i watched shore leave the other day .
story of a wrongly executed prisoner who haunts the prison he was electrocuted in and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who framed him.viggo mortensen is great , and the acting is pretty good overall .
gina lollobrigida as adeline holds her own .
the story is good .
as far as ichi 's role , the film is very different because he is n't in the film as much as usual .
hi , im scott ( a.k.a woody7739 ) i love the film twisted desire , and i love watching melissa joan hart on the t.v as i think she is fine .
this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time - the characters have no particular 'home ' which they leave .
i think this is kurt russell 's best movie .
the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable .
i will admit though that the story is on the thin side , and some scenes like screweyes 's death ( which still freaks me out ) may be a tad on the scary side .
after several episodes , no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock .
my third viewing of this film came in early april of 2005 , shortly after blake , in real life , was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife .
i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams `` the dingo took my baby ! ''
the following year jan opened on broadway in 'carousel . '
he 's got everything down , i 'm sure , with storyboards , and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions ( one of them is when all is said and done , and tadashi and the 'other ' human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot ) , but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots , and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant , and some visuals , like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map , just seem weak and pat .
it was , however , praised by many critics , james berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic .
the film is full of homages , pastiches , and references to other sf and fantasy films .
like i said , it is a pretty good movie , but i would rate `` toy story 2 '' or `` shrek '' higher .
10/10 .
its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything ( his lover , the terrorists , the colonel , annoying passengers , his disgruntled uncle , even the railway company 's officials who come to examine his work ethic ) before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control .
here 's louella o. parsons in the `` los angeles examiner '' on may 17 , 1934earl carroll 's hand-picked beauties ' pirouette about on the grauman united artists screen in a fig leaf and not much else .
what disappoints , however , is the climactic show itself ( after a fairly redundant midsection wherein kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on madison avenue ) which , rather than the expected splashy routines , procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of kermit and his eternal flame miss piggy !
it 's very different and unique and is very enjoyable .
these are people who ( sadly ) are not accepted in society -- only at the balls .
then there 's the `` old broad '' gambit that 's fun if you remember the old broads .
the images of the holocaust made me , a non-jewish european , feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people .
now , 8 year have passed , the more movies i 've seen , the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending , even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters 's own slackers included .
being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg , as an actor , that made me even more anxious to check out this flick .
as it turn out , it was a harbinger of things to come.. `` in cold blood '' did just that ! !
the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy hollywood propping or melodrama.i completely bought into the character 's motivations and reactions .
before he could make classics like `` the gardner , '' so i suppose he may be forgiven this initial excursion into mere sociological documentary .
in `` the raven '' lugosi is a sadistic surgeon , who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough .
i 'll be watching it again , just to hear the music .
but they all did one good deed : they gave money to riley , so he can get his wife out of prison .
this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller , everybody played their part to the hilt .
it simply delivers the die-hard fans what they have been expecting .
there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel , for example , when jess 's brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later .
in charlotte burke and elliott spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood ( often overlooked ) in a seamless and convincing way .
i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time .
anyway , maléfique was a good way to get my respect back .
i also love this episode because kyle gallner ( bart allen/impulse ) and justin hartley ( oliver queen/green arrow ) are guest starring in it ! ! !
that means you 've got kind of a weird unevenness , where sometimes there 's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse .
unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays { i was recently disappointed by wilder 's 'the seven year itch ( 1955 ) } , this film does n't simply strike at the same chord throughout , and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed , through tears , laughter and much disagreement .
bo derek 's beauty and john derek 's revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile .
he plays the same kind of role in the humphrey bogart film , the enforcer .
without question this 1984 version of dickens ' classic tale is the best ever made .
what a wonderful movie , eligible for so many labels it never gets : science fiction , film-noir , with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated , cultured audience ... ..the kind of english language movie only done in pre-1960 england ( and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived ) , and never , ever done in the usa.main characters in the man in the white suit ( 1951 ) starring sir alec guiness and joan greenwood routinely use polysyllabic , science reference words like `` polymer '' and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like `` long chain molecules '' and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.the man in the white suit ( 1951 ) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now ( 2009 ) dominate world cinema , and certainly dominate major usa cinema ... ... .it 's a carefully acted , intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors ( who play educated , accomplished people ) , and it 's all done with comedy , charm , pathos , and sense of irony which ancient greek dramatists would have approved of.everybody should see this movie , and someday , somehow , some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.it 's wonderful .
with such actors as ralph richardson , raymond massey , cedrick hardwicke , and margaretta scott , how can you go wrong .
it 's tragic , and you know she 's going to end up very hurt , but there 's nothing you can do .
into the arena rides prince albert , on a mission from king leopold of belgium , keen on political rapprochement between great britain and the rest of europe .
little by little , he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir .
this is one of the most brilliant movies that i have seen in recent times .
it 's a fine , appealing performance , but does n't go for the physical comedy implicit in the early scene where the young soldier can barely stay awake despite his mortal peril.these reservations notwithstanding , this is a solid production of a wonderful play transferred to the small screen with aplomb .
this movie is , for me , european-artistic-like movie made in the us , and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect .
i ca n't remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered .
this movie has it all .
and yes , there 's also john williams ' music.all told , while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle , the first and third acts deliver in style , making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.in 1997 , george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored ( and revamped ) `` special editions '' , which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements .
along with her party friends , she meets a mature turkish vendor .
i thought ben was being a huge jerk to ezra , a blind man just trying to make his way in the world .
ok so one more thing .
but the teleplay for the master blackmailer spent some time showing the horrible dilemma milverton 's victims ( in victorian/edwardian england ) faced .
i 'm not gon na say what cause that 'll spoil the hole movie .
next time you ask yourself `` what is the meaning of life '' , perhaps think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like as it is in heaven : happy , content , fulfilled .
it will not only touch your heart but it 's such a good family friendly film -- we need many more like these !

we rooted for caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of sheriff lucas .
based on the tragic event of the september 11th 2001 in the united states of america , eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the american tragedy .
in an age filled so-called 'monsters ' which are no more than laughable men-in-rubber-suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces ( cheap exploitation-style ) , it 's refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen-style stop-motion creature.quite a hard film to find , but it 's worth finding .
too often today kids are not willing to compromise .
val has the perfect life , she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment of the upper east side.the show basically shows all the problems vall and holly go through .
in fact , the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original , the only difference was the casting of american actors .
another is the cast .
not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film .
it 's about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone , who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman .
it allows for some genuinely nasty and remarkably entertaining gore scenes that do just as well as creating sympathy for the victims as thrilling the audience .
that 's why he signs up in the army where he can hide from the world .
the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role .
i thought she did a great job in this .
it is sad to see how sadie 's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding .
ha ha ha ! ''
what a fascinating film .
it 's easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files .
when she and albert argued , i loved it , i could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments , though that may be just me.lastly , at the risk of sounding all patriotic , it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position , especially in one so young .
acting , writing , music , editing , cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit .
this movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others .
what a lot of people do n't realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness/apocalypse now themes ( what happens when so-called `` civilization '' invades someone elses home , what does it mean to be `` civilized '' etc . ) .
plot is probably a fairy tale , do n't recall it now , but remember reading to my daughter-going-to sleep a similar story .
the end is always predictable , and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol , the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well.so what is it that makes this movie a near classic ?
or a simple porn star
with a yellow wig , a long red dress and makeup , patrick looked almost as good as the others .
on the contrary , my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80 's shock- feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting .

there was truly a disturbance in the force.this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance .
this is a lean , tight film-noir that is worth checking out even if you 're not familiar with fuller ( it 's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works ) .
normally i do n't like series at all .
the bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers , from time-traveling to swimming like a fish .
also , instead of just riding waves , we are handed more history and more personal insight to the world than before .
.
i ca n't get over it 's songs .
god bless cgi , because they 'd never be able to pull this off normally !
plot - in five years , they robbed twenty-seven banks and then vanished without a trace .
it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it .
it 's got frank sinatra and marlon brando ( and , contrary to sinatra 's original wishes , the casting works ) , it 's got a really cool 1950s feel , even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption .
absolutely hilarious .
that element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to , which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming .
it is worth it ! most of the time after seeing a stand-up routine a couple times , the jokes start to get old .
great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks , right ?
this is hard in color , but he did it in pictures like the searchers , painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner .
the casting is outstanding -- a film not to be missed !
clare danes was also super as his `` trainee/replacement '' .
the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red .
ms. mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles .
you need some sane characters that you can relate to in a realistic way , and that makes the insane stuff so much more interesting too because that forces you to take them seriously at some level .
as a viewer , you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos ' portrayal of this fragile woman named carla , whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty .
star rating : ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits mike atherton ( dudikoff ) is peacefully making his way in the wild west when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady .
the ghostly apparitions of the children 's souls being released was also good .
you gon na tell me he 's a fag ! ''
the unlucky montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her , and périer doesnt know either that montand had an affair with the girl .
craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue.as with many thrillers , the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero .
but it is another bogart picture , `` beat the devil '' which truman capote co-wrote , where a fictional treasure hunt is the mcguffin .
if you get a chance to see this movie do so .
what you 're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind , gussied up in lurid technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius .
stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult .
now for the film .
other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices , and it 's drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foul-mouthed language ( mostly from the man , as well as from the 'grandmother ' , who in one of lynch 's voices for the characters is the deepest of all ) , and a shaky quality that 's reminiscent of the cream of the crop from ( early ) hertzfeldt.all the same i 'm still not sure if dumbland is something i would put into someone 's hands if they have n't seen much of lynch yet let alone anything by him .
he even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line .
however it 's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what 's really going on here .
i just love the whole 80 's genre of these kind of movies , because you do n't see many like this one anymore !
this movie was one of the funniest movie i 've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me .
in fact sullavan 's husband was stewart 's good friend henry fonda back then.i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non-americans in mutiny on the bounty .
quite appropriate to the monk theme , the master-mind villain uses booby-trapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows , and also maintains a reptile-replete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences .
whilst making their escape , their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio , thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come ... the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived , one season run that has set it up for cult status.monty berman , the producer , was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in episodes such as `` happening '' ( a studio deputising for the australian outback ) and the 'snow ' sets of `` operation deep freeze '' and `` the beginning '' but if you can get past this , and focus on the characters and the story lines , the show was really a lot of fun .
perhaps mostly due to stephen rea 's excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both .
as an animated film from 1978 , this is pretty good -- generally well above the standard of the days when disney had n't done anything good in years ( and tolkien cared little for disney anyway ) .
like viren sahay , he also has a family ( a brother , wife and parents ) .
shortly afterward , he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood .
a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles .
it uses the now-popular technique of layering different scenes from different points of view , out of chronological sequence .
the closing ballet , superbly choreographed to the title music , makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists .
a good film with -- for its time -- an intense , sprawling , rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john ford 's `` the searchers '' though not so brutal .
however , the film was made before the production code was introduced , which made the censorship puzzling.garbo 's oscar nomination for `` anna christie '' was always somewhat mystifying , and i suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance .
yet , as this story unfolds , it becomes increasingly obvious that rage and desperation , not indifference , are the driving forces behind this man 's existence.more than once i was reminded of his performance in `` fargo , '' another strongly character-driven movie .
... for paris is a moveable feast . ''
where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you 'll need to see for yourselves .
his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised , making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol .
what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes ?
this movie gets it right .
jeffs brought one of his polygamist wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her braid and twisting it painfully till she came to her knees .
must remain in a military jail .
this is not only my favorite silent comedy , but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time .
only problem , i feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation .
angela lansbury is great as miss price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too : cindy o'callaghan as carrie , ian weighill as charlie ( a boy in « the age of not believing » ) and roy snart as the youngest brother paul.i like the black cat .
today 's tv broadcasting style , so different than that of 1986 , is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.the players are not the only stars .
i used to pretend to be a bad tv soap actor with my girlfriend .
in `` the lady from shanghai '' it 's the only time i see him holding the role of the victim .
the film contains standard structure , with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story 's style and the character 's motives , sets up a fast-paced theme of action , but lacks depth and strong character introduction .

watching these amazing dancers moving to the music of bizet is well worth checking out .
i ca n't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as i explain to them my favorite parts and memories !
it takes a long time for events to unfold out , and most of the time is spent on exposition .
i rank the film a 10 out of 10 .
pinjar is truly a masterpiece ... .
it is very much a circle of life , but not one that ca n't evolve with the ages.when thinking about the animation , it is actually quite good .
i 'm just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect .
i was swept up in the moment .
an unusual take on time travel : instead of traveling to earth 's past , the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet .
but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents ; then gag with gerald ford really summed him up !
notice how right after this , he left the wwf so he would n't have to job to razor .
set against this background , we first meet antonietta ( loren ) , a lonely , love-ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building .
that 's the beauty of 80 's slasher films , most of them i would say .
julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position .
let me get the bad out of the way first , james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day .
this makes me think that it must have been done with welles added for star power and an oscar push.i was lucky enough to find this vhs just recently and it is now my children 's favorite movie .
i am sure that you will either love or hate this film , with little room for a middle ground .
yes , it 's rules of the game redux .
although , i did not have to pay to see this movie , i would have gladly given 10.75 to see it .
this is some of the best cinematography i 've seen ; and i watch a lot of films .
well they 've both had 7 movies , 1 tv series , and 1 upcoming film .
i recommend this film to all .
i suspect 99 % of north american viewers will just not get it .
we can get by that .
cage is at his best .
everything about this film , from the way it was shot , the incredible performance of gena rowlands , the credits , the opening , the music , the plot , the sense of depth , the pace , the tenderness , the originality , the characters , the deft little moments ... . for me , is truly sublime .
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site .
morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999 .
some of the segements are weak while others are very strong ; some are political , some are not ; some are solely about 9/11 , some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch on human feelings , emotions and tragedies that are universal ; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic ) .
this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being .
he plays a main character antonio , the famous dancer/choreographer who works on retelling the story of carmen in the flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hand clapping and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers.brilliant and graceful cristina hoyos whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role .
how then , can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will ?
ontop of it being action filled , they even have a surprised put in there for you .
i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people ca n't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories , mine being one of them .
he also continues to mention the `` science fiction '' told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies.extras : gallery , trailers , and interviews , most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40 % of the scenes , yet can not recall which ones or any other significant details.bottom line : a must see for zombie and fulci fans.rating : 7/10molly celaschi www.horroryearbook.com myspace.com/horroryearbook
madhur bhandarkar has given it all raw .
hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction , and there the movie fails to convince hitler 's portrayal.even though the venture was for tv , all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie .
the commentary is superb , probably the best that i 've heard , covering the cinematography , the framing and lighting of shots , the production design , the casting of non-professional actors in small roles , and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot , like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally .
the most beautiful scene : the old viennese man , watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental way ' , as he is calling it .
but that 's me .
the film has been released on dvd in germany , with both german and english soundtrack .
!
it takes us into the lifes of 8 main characters that live through a friday- and night .
it is perfectly acted and all the production values are good , but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message .
but after watching it again yesterday i 've found it to be amazing.a good blend of comedy ( although not as great as `` mr magoo '' -another one of my favorites ) and action .
you can imagine though how the no-nonsense parnell handles the situation afterward , when loy leaves him with his paint crew .
because the unwavering racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the nibelungs as the good guys , even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin .
he had an instant screen presence , and i could n't help but love him .
the acting performances were great and the script was equally great.helen hunt was magnificent as the riverside police officer gina pulasky .
!
i can understand why many viewers , especially , the females would not like or even hate it .
excellent episode , this is one i 'm buying for sure .
hidden frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website , with interesting discussion forums , access to creative , production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat .

greetings again from the darkness .
the movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have , not the ones we do not or can not have .
an english-indian girl and her parents , with their traditions and strong family ties , and on the other hand the english family with a daugther who dresses like a boy , and plays soccer ... a combination which worries her mother !
first off , let 's start with the negative points : 1 ) there are huge , gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered ; 2 ) the movie is not for all people , so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie.point two above is important because the movie is very quiet .
the actress gretchen moll portrays her , and gets down the spirit of this woman about as well as she could , which is really a lot of the success of the film .
his saving grace , a rising starlet sophie maes ( megan fox ) who develops an odd affection for him .
sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway .
the revolutionaries , of whom we see and about whom we learn very little , might as well be mafiosi .
etc .
!
it was awesome !
maybe you 'll end up like them .
she and her pallid office-bound son belong to the american version of von ramme 's and de brancovis ' privileged kind .
to enjoy this movie completely you ca n't have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film .
wwii was still a few years away .
explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers , since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series .
far beyond the likes of cars , and even walle .
getting past these low points of the movie , it is actually a great movie , considering the suspense , the characters and the plot .
so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops .
this was my favorite performance of the year by far .
also present : jealous , uptight spinster ( siv ) ( check ) ; geriatric whose soul still sings ( check ) ; elderly couple who may have repressed desires for each other since kindergarten ( check ) ; obese person whose function is to point out we should not laugh and say 'fatty ' ( check ) ; intellectually handicapped boy who proves able to sing a good 'a ' ( check ) .pollak 's film is not all warm fuzzies , however .
arkin ( h20 : halloween , 20 years later ) shows nice timing in the lead role .
great fun .
hey , it 's an independent movie , with a shoe-string budget , so , ya , it 's going to look a bit cheesy ( if your standard is a-list hollywood fare ) .
helms won the match after blowing yang away with a facebuster on the knee .
the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match-winning tombstone.in other notable happening from the card .
some years back , a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material , cobbled together from various european existing prints available , restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the vatican condemned it as `` decadent '' ( yeah , right ... like the church never did anything wrong ) , and the hayes office cut it to ribbons , when it was finally released in the u.s.a. in 1936 , in a `` hayes office '' approved cut ( likewise ) .
`` jake speed '' is a fine movie with a wonderful message .
i especially like `` take me on '' and `` beer '' by reel big fish .
the weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories , but based on the stories themselves , this is a classic !
oshii said his ulterior motive was homage to the `` art '' of eating food on the streets  something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country , and which goes some way toward explaining the use of `` tachigui '' in the title.the director of live-action movies ( avalon , stray dog ) as well as animation , oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums .
but for all others , enjoy !
whether one buys or rejects the goldenhagen thesis that most germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-nazi endemic anti-semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on.the elderly lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was `` a ray of light '' in an evil time .
when dvd 's were released en mass , it was one of the first movies i replaced .
the love story is portrayed beautifully and you can really feel the longing in this love and longing for a regular life .
bud ( travolta ) and sissy ( debra winger ) meet at gilley 's and fall in love .
it was also realized that no print any smaller or of lesser quality than this original one in cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering .
!
also the effects are good , and i think most of them very made without cgi .
some real laugh out loud moments , all revolving around sex and his crudeness .
that was probably a good thing.this is a film that you , apparently , either love or hate .
`` in april 1946 , the university of chicago agreed to operate argonne national laboratory , with an association of midwestern universities offering to sponsor the research .
heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when i think of `` secret games '' .
it 's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago .
it 's a surreal comedy -- tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove .
james ellison was buffalo bill , john miljan ( not a villain as usual ) was general george a. custer , and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn .
it ended with a simple message saying : `` please do n't do any of the above in my movie '' .there is a fact about this movie ( definitely true ) .
forever more , `` do you have a flag ? ''
busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music , actors make irrational character changes from line to line , the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot , and you 'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs .
not to say the technical side of zabriskie point is n't involving to a degree ( this may make some feel drowsy , as antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say francis ford coppola is ) .
those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie .
matthau & burns were terrific in this film .
such a shame , as i would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir storyline and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style.oh , and the english dub is great too.all in all a great film and highly recommended .
the local scottish cast are exceptional , the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold .
i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming .
my favorite movie genre is the western , it 's really the only movie genre that is of american origin .
in `` the fourth man '' he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity ( of which there 's plenty ) but , as in most of his films , he seems afraid the audience would n't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes .
if you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated , you 'll enjoy d-war .
and it is wonderful that movies that i enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation .
- what makes this movie so special is the three main actors - grant , myrna loy , and melvyn douglas .
i am so surprised that other commentators did n't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie , so i can only assume that those who 've written comments have yet to see the notebook .
and like in every one of these movies , the pretty girl is a decent person who has sympathy for the alienated main character , yet continues to go out with her jock boyfriend .
while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop , `` stardust '' is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film i 've ever seen .
lassalle 's fate is a masterful effects sequence .
it earns it 's praise
way excellent !
highly recommended .
he 's hit by a truck .
overall , however , an 8/10 .
i know that in the novel harriet was a naïve young teenager , whereas here she is more like the character collette played in `` muriel 's wedding '' - a gauche , slightly overweight twentysomething , fretting about her chances of finding a man .
the filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material .
it 's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast .
music has been a major part of kubrick 's movies ( 2001 : a space oddysey and a clockwork orange , just to name a couple ) and he definitely does n't disappoint with this one .
while the story is sweet , and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy , the uniqueness of the film ( and what makes it a masterpiece ) is the dream sequence .
an actor playing kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes .
it is though , gunga din who saves the day .
although cameron grant was clearly hired to replace andrew blake over at ultimate pictures when the latter started his own company ( studio a ) , he practically outdid the `` master '' right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes .
but even without an extra point for nostalgia , this is still a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story , uncanny atmosphere , blood-soaked killing sequences and superb casting choices .
the four young actresses jodie foster , cherie currie , marilyn kagan and kandice stroh are wonderful .
stephen rea .
i loved it , all segments from 60's-present day .
this is a very beautiful film .
the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with .
i 've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time .
either you 'll completely love it or you will totally hate it .
it forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots .
it heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection .
we know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator .
that 's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn .

having heard from jermaine 's friends kevin ( derek taylor ii ) and marco ( raul martinez ) about the attack on the gangsters , ricky feels that the only thing to do is to capture jermaine and try to cover up the whole matter before he and his accomplice scott ( chris angelo ) get arrested for the mayhem they 've caused .
rachel ward is fay , the sexy femme fatale who we ca n't quite figure out ... it 's not your standard film noir , nor is it intended to be .
jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.to me the film feels like unfinished .
despite her very short role , i have apologise and admit to ogling ! overall , i have to say , did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the 'original ' .
her photos and films never sexual , never pornographic , but she presented as a near caricature of all things kinky .

( this is , by the way , the best carol kane role since she played latke 's wife in taxi . )
he invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart.the apartment is very dreary and dark .
i was n't even entirely sure what i was seeing , but i will never forgot it , especially the scene with ned beatty.watching it today , thirty-six years later , it still gives me quivers.my father was a huge burt reynolds fan , hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie . '
i recently bought this movie and i do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact i am very please have this movie to add to my collection .

check again .
they also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster .
however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try .
i participate in a filmmaker 's symposium , and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a 40 minute discussion .
he was quite terrific in `` boys n the hood '' ( 1991 ) - i 've always considered his amusing role of furious styles as his very greatest achievement .
of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands , also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring .
i do the same thing when i find cnn headline news or for that matter , programs which i find biased or offensive .
don cheadle gives another great performance , but is out-shined by sandler .
going into hock buying an engagement ring for mildred in an attempt to ask for her hand in marriage the cold hearted mildred tells the startled philip that she 's already engaged to be married to emil miller , alan hale .
another thing.when i read the book , i was surprised at how much religion ther was in it , but here they had axed that all out ! 7\10
ooverall , the movie was fairly good , a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes , but chuck norris did hardly anything , except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters .
it will never be accepted , not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition .
same went for the dodos , who are using melons as their food supply.the gags in this movie are very funny .
a combination of winston churchill and edina from absolutely fabulous comedy series .
in fact we see latham grow up in this film , when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good , he sees that his own lot is not so bad.this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen .
now , with this focus on mass action , lang is presented with greater challenges in staging .
also , nancy describes the cold case she 's about to investigate as a murder taking place at an extravagant party , which should yield plenty of potential murderers , but she only encounter a handful of suspects .
i appreciated the beautiful score , which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story .
edie mcclurg ( `` ferris bueller 's day off '' ) and jane alden make for a hilarious duo as the stepsisters .
that , however , is not my major problem .
some detectives !
to my surprise the acting was n't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good .
well , if it was n't for halloween , those characters would n't have haunted our dreams when we were children.halloween 's director , john carpenter , got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s .
cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation .
this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons , including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script .
this movie is very entertaining , and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality .
it is to me better than batman , the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time .
i 'm amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film .
had this been an nbc show , this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are .
this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun .
it 's sort of like in karate kid when mr. miagi teaches daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores- `` wax on , wax off '' et cetera .
hopefully , one day , there 'll be some way to watch the rovers in action again .
the important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so .
a movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it ; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations i have ever seen .
contrary to some people 's summaries , the women depicted in the film are not geisha .
the reveal at its conclusion leaves you a bit off balance as the infatuation between the two changes hands.quatier latin : ben gazzara and gena rowlands ( recreating a relationship from an old cassavettes film ? )
therein lies my only criticism -- the video package states something like 71 minutes , and at least one online source claims the film to be 67 minutes , but apparently it 's more like 61 minutes of rocking fun .
and if so , how often to you meet the same souls life after life .
the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment .
it goes through there daily actives ( and that is making a gun .
people are being too hard on the film .
she makes a perfect damsel .
the act of running is a metaphor for these down-on-their luck people 's lives .
the castaways are so dramatic yet we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and so much more to say and they have secrets affecting the other castaways that die with them .
`` the house that bled to death '' is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer-fans should like to see in a short horror tale .
the cutting edge of the plot is compromised and the screen-time between falk and cassidy inexcusably lessens at this point to perhaps help the script-writer ( stephen bocho ) out of a tight corner , since he can not singularly develop the story without another murder.the climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode .
`` my word ! ''
however i must say this movie does n't come under the `` average flick of weekend '' which you pick at random and watch gleefully ; it carries strong sentiments and characters so do n't wash this one down with your beer and pop-corns .
) , the music was great ( the sixties had the best music ever , imho ) , the historical material was interesting , and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s .
dola in particular is hard to get right , but leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman ( her sons are n't quite as good as the original ) .
very nicely done movie .
i was pleasantly surprised .
there was an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film .
it 's all stuff we have seen in coming of age dramas of course , but this is combined as a musical , a very stylised musical.the cast are good .
the main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled .
extreme gore , yes yes , extreme extreme gore .
the story reverts to normal for a while , but it does n't take long before any and all logic goes down the drain and the young boy teams up with a group of miyazaki rejects to take out the evil sorcerer.the plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times , the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichés , but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world .
they also fucus on the military actions taken during the war , and the holocaust .
) quaid is believable in playing jim morris because , unlike actors in the past in sports films , he knows how to throw a baseball .
firefall - this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans , but i enjoyed it because it 's got a great red herring and a really creepy , almost unstoppable-seeming monster.though i 've singled out these three episodes for praise , i 'd say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least .
matthew mcconaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent wesley doyle ( powers boothe ) in his fbi office .
indeed , i 'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'police story ' at all .
the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up .
there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies .
the obvious inspiration behind the successful tv series `` bewitched , '' this lovely sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure .
this is some of the best acting you 'll ever see .
as a kung fu film in general , it also stands out ...
my final rating 9/10
it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years , nay , after 60 years since the war finished.i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy .
it is easy to watch because it is animated , which makes it unthreatening .
i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film.kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend , art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to duchovny 's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers .
what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another .
years went by and i forgot the title of the film , and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again .
most of the actors were from austrailia and new zeland , and the repressed accents are detectable at times.although the main structure of the film sticks to historical fact , there are many deviations , some for seemingly inexplicable reasons .
this is the first `` 3 '' movie this summer to at least match , if not exceed , the original and that is saying something.a-
thus , most of goldsworthy 's works do n't really last , except as photos or films of what they were .
it has only one message : no war is holy .
the 70 's were not a *great* period for special effects , and the show suffers for it , but if you suspend disbelief , what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it 's time .
when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right .
i became an instant eddie fan after seeing dress to kill , but i must say i think this is his best work .
but overall , it 's a well-made reality show , which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron .
well , for starters , this is shot differently , much along the lines of `` cloverfield , '' `` blair witch project , '' and `` diary of the dead . ''
thankfully they got a top-notch cast ... .merylstreep 's daughter , mamie gummer , plays the young lila , and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lila ... in addition to an amazing resemblance ( duh ! )
there he encounters a vivacious & talented bedouin girl , living in poverty .
there are scenes where it looks like the actor can not move within , or that he 's almost falling over .
it has a beautiful menzies art design , but mediocre special effects ( esp .
mr. d'arc , who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film , has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a dvd .
secret sunshine ( 2007 ) is famous for its awards at the festival de cannes in 2007 and other film festivals .
the young women workers in china have various points of view , and the owner is amazingly open about the discipline .
first of all i am a butch , straight white male .
sudden impact was overall better than the enforcer in my opinion .
it is at the same time sad and mysterious .
after the success of die hard and it 's sequels it 's no surprise really that in the 1990s , a glut of 'die hard on a ... .. ' movies cashed in on the wrong guy , wrong place , wrong time concept .
this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god .
if this film had come out at the end of 1988 , instead of rain man , hulce would certainly have been at least nominated for a best actor oscar .
the other catch is if he touches the person again , they 're dead again , but this time for good .
mcdonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements .
oh , yeah , i even half-covered my eyes a few times !
and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives.the answers , while seeming to be boring and mundane , are actually quite funny , when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later.how many of these animals look like the person making the statements ?
sad , but worth it .
astounding color and fast energy .
this is not a war movie .
david burton ( richard chamberlain , quite good ) is a lawyer , more adept at handling corporate taxation ( ..and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness ) , who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy..we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie ( nandjiwarra amagula ) uses a `` death bone '' to stop his heart .
it was very original .
i really ca n't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year .
a betrothed woman ( lucy ) arrives at the family home of her would be husband ( mathurin ) in france , where they are awaiting the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or someone in the catholic church to marry them ( to satisfy a will . )
if you are reading this review a few years from now and the idea of this film sounds intriguing , see if it has ever been released on video .
the first character ( luis luque ) is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him ; and has to work on a case.the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective .
with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do .
it 's a bit slow but the immersion was complete .
as everything else in this film , her acting is unique - it is completely her own - neither `` british '' nor `` american '' nor anything else i have ever seen .
is n't this a rather consoling thought ? when i watched it for the first time , i thought that after the won election , the movie would be over - i did n't know the book .
remember whoopi goldberg at the shredding machine ?
richard chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here .
i know ... sounds kooky ... but it is .
and to top it off , jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978 , but that wo n't be out until 2007 .
as a result , the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re-released after 1934 .
but i already talked about those in my comment on the mini series .
the pace slows down and ... ji hoon suddenly realizes he cares for su wan more than he could ever imagine .
robson green brings an enigmatic smile , a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he 's just begun to work .
in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery , without the mayhem.this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages .
this is due to john hurt 's brilliant voice acting .
the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious , meaningful and haunting .
the score stands tall , and a cd of the material , with gershwin and weill , only underscores its merits , which are considerable .
unfortunately over here it caused a `` panic hysteria '' amongst the mothers because batman was considered as too violent .
while katie manages to just grab joe pesci 's glasses and get free from being injected , mr. big decides he 's had enough and orders his men to kill katie before finishing off jackson , but not before a shooting star flies by .
this is probably the second best role i have seen him in ( second only to 'o brother where art thou ? ' ) .
i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names .
) vhs new line home video .
i wish you were n't my brother so i could **** you ! )
all of which makes his key scene in the movie all the more poignant.although some of the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated ( also note the video game shown in the film ) , but the subject of the film is pretty much timeless .
***1/2 from ****
it 's about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk .
do n't miss it .
my rating for this is 8/10
firstly , i have heard great things about this film , not least among the retro/vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love bettie page and it did not disappoint .
however , my main memory of this one is the opening of a scene in the middle of the film , between columbo and the murderer ( i apologise if i 've not remembered every detail of this exactly ) .
janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it .
this film is very close to jon anderson 's definitive bio on che and gets the story right .
short , fast paced , and entertaining , `` baby face '' is as contemporary in its morality as `` wall street . ''
who needs a story with fighting like that ?
additionally there is a good music video.1 .
is he insane ?
robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s .
while the injured girl learns a deep , meaningful truth on her once sheltered life and the outside world , alisha learns that complete abandonment of society and locking everything inside is not always the best thing.many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things .
not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee , it had many young actors who were to become major stars , e.g. , tobey maguire ( before spiderman ) , skeet ulrich ( before jericho ) , jonathan rhys meyers ( before tudors ) , james caviezel , simon baker , mark ruffalo , jeffrey wright , tom wilkinson , and jewel .
the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane 's soprano version of the famous tarzan yell .
i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard ( captain midnight ) webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event .
you 're not quite too old to do what you had dreamed of as a kid , but it 's getting there .
`` alas no one listened , but that does not mean it should not have been said .
after having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of imdb for `` pushing daisies '' , and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode , i thought it was about time i said what i thought of pd.first off , to address what some of the issues that i have seen other people having with this show : something along the lines of `` i expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction '' .
yet there are a few colorful comic relief .
the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends !
jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity .
it 's so original and so entertaining .
wizards of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince ( simon ) who is banished from his kingdom due to his father ( the king ) being killed by the cliche `` evil adviser '' .
'till one or the other surfaces , this production will please anyone who loves good shaw .
the plot was filled with surprises , a little kid pretends to be a grown up inherits one million dollars and how he spends it .
why has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence ?
i 'm really sad that the soap ended but i 'm sure i 'll be able to find it somewhere .
this 1939 film from director john ford and writer lamar trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer abraham lincoln , his trials ( literally ) and his tribulations .
so those of you who are complaining that vader 's helmet was removed , take a moment to think about it .
however , i have a feeling , thanks to netflix , this movie will find a life of its own .
if you liked bette davis and george brent , this is the film for you !
surprisingly , i enjoyed it very much !
more effective than contemporary 'drama . '
( i hope me and my friends are n't like that in twenty years !
everytime i watch it i feel happy .
his mother is enraged and forbids him to go - so of course he caves in to her request.years pass .
caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels , and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing.i really did n't know what to expect after reading the program summary , but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed .
this movie is completely ridiculous .
then pierce brosnan called .
it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past , but seems more contemporary .
.
let 's hope that the world is n't going to end up like this ... soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much .
c3po and r2d2 provide ( as usual ) great comic relief .
it is worth the watch if you fan of indies and/or short films.ps .
there are several `` themselves '' cameos by real conductors , singers , etc .
what was truly interesting was how political it was , maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration .
.
the first twist hits early on , and from there it 's a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town .
vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic/household settings , while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover-up .
he plays drew johnson , a family-less adult , who is willing to pay complete strangers .
the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they 're herded around outside in little yellow jackets .
it looked like bollywood finally gave away it 's glamor and had some quality artists performing on screen.content wise , the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one 's life goes beyond religion.the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodrama.i simply loved it .
the dialogue , the pacing and mann 's direction are excellent .
the honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end.this movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives .
it 's obviously way past that year now , but the dub has been finally completed .
then on 11/21/01 i saw the 30th aniversy of this movie dvd .
but this really is n't a particularly violent film .
who built all these fabulous monuments , castles and cities ... and why are they falling apart ?
it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique .
at 83 , director sidney lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue , and in fact , he revels in the melodramatic turns of first-time screenwriter kelly masterson 's thickly plotted script.the scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash .
!
for example , there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi 's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai , and shojo -- the avuncular kirin herald -- does what many a stressed-out japanese adult would do .
it 's a hit or miss game , which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has ( which i 'm not ) , they 'd seem primitive ( particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years ) .acting here is not a plus point because it does n't need to be .
i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues .
yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form .
it 's very confusing and pointless .
another thing i must add : how hot are the women in this film ? ? ?
in spanish with english subtitles.grady harp
i 'm from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it .
but if you have young kids its still appropriate .
it 's about time that felix needed to lighten up .
it 's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted .
in the sea of crap that hollywood ( and others ) continue to put out , this is one of those diamonds in the rough .
in the directors ' narration , they say it is a new type of 3d technology , and it really works .
some episodes are on-world , meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth.through the years , you start to see a decline in the sg-1 team as close knit , and more character-building story lines .
the scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast .
was the creator speaking to us on deeper levels of human carnality and or what could be considered a true abomination , interracial relations , bed frame masturbation , voyeurism , or could it be desperation for social status to the point of murder , pedophilia/homosexuality , or the repressed sexual nature of social elitist females in 18th century france ?
it 's a masterpiece of hong kong cinema.sinnui yauman , is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film .
back to the issue of sexuality , we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game ( the official reason is that the men are bad ) .
if you were to watch only one part , do n't miss kelly 's dance with jerry mouse .
i liked it , i hope you do.the rookie .
she dances like wind .
also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again .
the casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well .
here we have a film , 9 years before blade runner , that dares to imagine the future as somthing dark , scary , and nihilistic .
we can easily understand , that is , why his character would be attracted to hers , but it 's less clear why hers would be attracted to his.still , the movie works as a light romantic fantasy .
i saw him .
!
first movie ?
spring in park lane had been a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker .
and , by the way , the original location in the story was colombia .
i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy .
a year later came this anime film , which is n't a sequel to the series , but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie .
the film is very much about the special effects , with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments , much like the storm riders and a man called hero .
her slipper is not glass ( truer to the original story ) , but cinderella loses is nonetheless but gets it back from the heir to the throne .
christian viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard-gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema 's sexiest and most notorious stars .
in answer to the question posed by the nice work if you can get it , there is n't much you could ask more for this film.except a leading lady .
they certainly do n't make them like this anymore .
there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence .
it is in the tribeca film festival , and it is going to london and athens , greece .
this is something i rarely see in japanese films , being that frank in their discussion of that era , and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources channeled toward the war effort.the actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles , be they the veterans or the child actors .
just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time , picked it up one night previously viewed at blockbuster and absolutely loved it , i 've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well .
ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor .
supernatural climax , tacky make-up f/x , and one of those lovably lame `` it was all just a terrible dream '' fake-out non-endings .
the plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in italy .
my reaction to it was that it is entertaining , well acted ( for the most part ) , has some very witty dialogue , and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm , appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte .
the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent .
endings , or just a such a semi-conventional thriller.but it 's a surprise that pays off because , oddly enough , altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior , or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble , of a small-town georgian environment .
it had good acting , dialogue , plot , and the scenery was beautiful .
in one of the best final shoot outs ever , the two meet in the final showdown .
still , stewart plays it so damn well , he makes this character very human .
the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone .
unfortunately this movie was not mass produced , and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it .
their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.love is a strange thing .
i wish i knew it was going to be canceled , why did n't they tell us ?
the first-rate acting helps out a lot .
cristina raines has her wooden moments , but came though in a big way for the most part .
in my opinion , though , stealing the show was frances fisher as rose 's mother .
sam tarasco plays one of the guys who pays ricky for an extermination , and then he plays sam losco in the series.also ( again ...
the oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against , humphrey bogart for casablanca , gary cooper in for whom the bell tolls , mickey rooney in the human comedy , and walter pidgeon for madame curie .
whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it .
both versions are very good but i prefer this one .
james dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author .
i think it was to focused on her towards the end .
jack haley is also great to watch , i admit that i only know him from w o oz and i loved him there , and i also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show .
for every vile bodies there was some failure late in his career like the ordeal of gilbert pinfold .
and did n't she look fantastic ? !
but you buy the difference easily , as that is often the way we change through life , from enthusiasm to sorrow , or indifference.indeed well worth the money !
it 's a wake up call .
an insomniac 's nightmare is the story of a man 's plunge into insanity .
it 's hard to believe this is ishai setton 's first film .
this is the story of him and the man who trained him , helping him to become the first african-american us navy diver .
it starts off strong , and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed .
because under all the campiness , it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel ( and justifiably so ) for the boring , stupid , fascist , establishment world of adults .
) the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women .
he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis .
i will say that in the first 20 minutes or so , some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines , but stick around .
the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you .
a horrible person , yes , but never a paper hanger !
during this film , you 'll probably think about your own dentist a few times .
both of them get involved with crime , andrew suffers from paranoia and simply does n't dare going out of the house .
of course these movies lack quality , lack a sophisticated storyline , very often lack first-class acting , but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that 's okay .
i was so entertained throughout this insightful documentary , and i waited a good while for this to come through the pipes ( my local video chain ) , and it was worth the wait .
all three pows who tried to escape actually hit home runs ( escaped successfully to their home base . ) .
it is also a riveting detective story , well made and well told .
recommended , much like all old universal horrors ...
the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability , and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable .
( according to a moderator on an abc message board , some sort of further dvd release is due in december 2009 )
if you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you did n't like you took for granted they are way better than this .
a flamboyant showman he might have been , but `` house '' and the other two films i 've mentioned were good movies .
it should be no secret many actors/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of `` midnight cowboy '' .
and tim roth is a superlative villain .
i 've already watch the making of guinea pig 1 .
i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his/her reluctant guardian .
too bad they are all gone now .
the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good .
we 've toured an england callously occupied by germany in `` it happened here '' ( 1966 ) .
soraj 's movies have been brilliant all the way so we always expect something different from him .
what a gem of a movie , so good that they made a sequel.the film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other.bendan hughes plays the eccentric vlad , a bit of an inkling there to who this character is , who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house.hell , we 've all seen vampire movies , we know the format.the movie is watchable , but the actors ' performances are very wooden and they seem as they do n't want to be in this film , but may be that 's just all part of the decadent ambiance.did n't like the ending , but there is a sequel , must track it down.when i watched the film i thought brendan hughes did n't really fit the part .
overall , this is a brilliant film not to be missed !
the shoveller ( bill macy ) works construction during the day , and at night , leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique shovel-fighting style .
i love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way .
debbie taps , tangos and tricks up a lá harlow , while winters ' religious fanatic has a lesbian edge to her .
not to say the movie is bad , because it is n't - the book is just a little bit better .
look , in the bosnia short film , the message is : `` you cry because of the people who died in the towers , but we ( the others = east europeans ) are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you '' .even though the burkina fasso story is more in comedy , there is a the same thought : `` you are angry because osama bin laden punched you in an evil way , but we ( the others = africans ) should be more angry , because our people is dying of hunger , poverty and aids long time ago , and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you '' .look now at the sean penn short : the fall of the twin towers makes happy to a lonely ( and alienated ) man .
the 1980s .
even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper , the official , and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic .
is this a short term fix for her , or is she destined to become the female counterpart of hector ?
i agree it 's not an oscar caliber movie .
tom hulce* turns in yet another oscar-worthy performance as dominick luciano , the brain-damaged garbage man who 's helping put his brother ( ray liotta as eugene ) through medical school.this is a must-see for all movie lovers and all lovers of life and people ! =========== > *from the small studder to the eratic dancing , to the repeated words `` oh , jeez '' whenever nicky is in a bind , the belieavablitly of tom 's performance is so excellent that you will have to concentrate to remember that it 's an actor on screen !
he does what he does best , to the best of his not inconsiderate ability , and so provides an example .
the villains are appropriately menacing and frightening .
the notorious bettie page ( 2006 ) ***1/2 gretchen mol , lilli taylor , chris bauer , jared harris , sarah paulson , david strathairn , austin pendleton , norman reedus , dallas roberts .
as many times as i 've seen this movie , the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were .
perhaps it was n't directed or written as well as it could have been but i am telling you that danes and gere together make this movie completely watchable and a really great thriller .
along the way the plot bristles with 50 's stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you 're watching it , but always do .
superlative make up ( a certain oscar ) costumes , sets , music make this the hit summer movie of 2001 .
also , some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves .
both lack the infectious energy of cagney however , who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical .
without naming them all , the rest of the cast is wonderful .
at first i did n't did n't like it that much , although i did .
keith gordon is maybe one of the most underrated actors of our time .
as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters ( all hobbits and the main cast ) and real actors covered with paint .
i did n't find it as awe-inspiring as `` laura , '' but few things in this world are .
it has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be .
like many italian horror films that came out throughout the late eighties , this movie is pretty stylish and effective , but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moments , that make the movie unforgettable in a way .
as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season , this was actually the best one yet.the issue of the `` right to die '' is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device .
the father 's double standard is illustrated by the fact that tiny , the brother , is taking boxing lessons at the local gym , but diana is denied similar pursuits .
no other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele , and no actress ever will .
the problem is they have n't even seen each other in over a decade .
he is crazy to have his own house and his own rules , since his brothers always stole his saved money and his parents neglect his wishes .
i do n't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd , i would never get tired of watching it .
which results to be one of my favorite movies ever !
if this problem continues , then the day when there is no girl child , is not far away.so , keep in mind this statement , today 's youth must understand that we can not take dowry in marriages.we have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be taken.and if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society .
darren stein is a director .
while she 's quite recognizable , her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year later -- giving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just did n't see in subsequent films .
even non-streisand fans will enjoy this highly energetic and entertaining piece of entertainment history .
timothy dalton is amazing as rochester .
i also agree with semprinni that the recordings pete best plays on say the last word on the subject of why he was fired.although the film is not such a lavish production as the later film `` backbeat '' , i prefer this film because it is more accurate , and because it has a better script with deeper characterisation.there is plenty in the film that is quite substantial - such as brian epstein trying to hide the fact that he has been `` queer-bashed , '' only to find out that the band knew he was gay all along .
make no mistake this is her picture.mr gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together .
then she stops acting so innocent and kills buzz and later on attempts to kill richard whom she supposedly loves and cares for .
well done .
the movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth waiting for .
there are tons of memorable quotes .
an edgy , stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to vhs and cable tv -- where i first saw it .
joe buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic , while we begin to feel pity for ratso later in the film.i think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground-breaking for its period .
neither was guilty , but faced with charges and their house about to be torn down , they ended up in , well , nothing .
anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one !
! you have to see this movie ! ! !
while not at the forefront , buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie , much like kurosawa 's `` ran '' .
had there been more time , had the story been more about lucy 's entire life , then maybe the kids woulda been there more .
unbelievable funny ! you 've got to see it ! ! !
the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon , who , sadly , died the following the year .
in going to dr .
mr sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour .
it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front .
that seems impossible to say the least .
steve buscemi really shines and sells the performance without speaking a word .
domenico scala and aldo tonti ( who would lens some of rossellini and fellini 's films ) help in envisioning the look of ossessione , which is usually moving in on a character , then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces , their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly , sad and dark and romantic .
sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone before.very well done guys .
but it 's a fairy tale , and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow .
this movie is in the same class as elvira , mistress of the dark , another incredibly funny , underappreciated film .
however , that does n't mean someone wo n't try to get their hands on the treasure.after the disappointment of mr. moto 's gamble , i went into mr. moto takes a vacation hoping for the best , but , admittedly , fearing the worst .
simply put it 's a much graphically superior game ; the textures are sharp , levels are easy to navigate , and it has much better sound then it 's ps cousin .
nevertheless , if one were to deconstruct fay grim , one would see many instances in which countless scenes could 've been squeezed for much more benefit than they have resulted in being.this sort of filmed in-joke is the sequel to hal hartley 's henry fool , which was made ten years earlier .
it is something else , and frankly i do n't know how they filmed some of it .
the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding .
despite a brief scene in which jerry springer makes a feeble attempt at justifying his existence , i definitely recommend this movie for sheer entertainment value .
now dark heart starting to care & became a real boy to fall in love with christy .
ford 's camera has only praising views to reveal of mr. lincoln 's early life .
they give emotional punch to the intellectual case for stepping off the sidelines , for actively facing down torturers and murderers .
i have n't always been a fan of fonda 's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time .
i love maureen o'sullivan most of all in this film .
then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers
all of his great virtues are here : the cramped interiors broken up by gliding , complex , delicious camera movements ; a melancholy deployment of light and shade ; remarkable , wistful sets by alexander trauner , which are so evocative that they , as the title suggests , take on a shaping personality of their own ; the quietly mournful music of maurice jaubert ; a seemingly casual plot about romance , tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters ; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time , in this case louis jouvet and arletty.in fact , the film 's biggest failing , and i find myself astonished ( as someone who usually , didactically , minimises its importance ) to admit it , is its script .
they 're certainly facile .
the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters .
for it has been told for years and years .
this film is chock full of character development and plot line ; the kind that we used to analyze when i was in high school .
this does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary , mostly well meaning , basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life .
that 's the huge difference : eddie was original , funny , provocative , thoughtful  and more .
anyhow , she 's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society .
as thriller/horrors go , this film ai n't too bad , it is certainly very watchable .
`` amazing grace '' has a languid feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building .
the amazing thing about `` the sunshine boys '' is how much it rubs your noses in willy 's almost existential condition without turning you off at all .
once he 's purchased the house , bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim 's 'dream house ' goes wrong.one of three collaborations between grant and loy , this is a charming little comedy -- not very taxing , with no real great message , but a great way to spend an hour or two .
guiness ' performance ( and a great supporting cast such as greenwood , thesiger , and parker ) and mackendrick 's direction make the film a delight , but the real hero is the story itself , a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama , romance , and suspense .
best of all , though , he allowed himself to cut loose for the long ballet sequences that end all his movies .
he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions .
the passion of the dance , the quality of the acting , the love of art , and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that , once again , blends and twists the line between life and art .
surely !
it 's about the worst night in laurie strode 's short life .
8 of 10
and , matthau 's bellowing tends to get a little old .
still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that 's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget .
he almost gets with a overly drunk woman , he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl , and almost with his own boss ( jane lynch , also very funny in the mockumentaries ) as a ( explitive ) buddy .
plus , in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic .
jack bull and jake do not like the war and do not like killing ; but they are standing up for what they believe to be right .
as for the look of the film , it could not be better .
even the small parts are great.there are so many funny scenes , mathau messing up the commercial , burns repeating his answers as if senile ... a delight.enterrrrrr !
cothk does say it starts 5 years after the war of heros which parn was a part of .
when a man dies in a plane crash his wife ( ida galli ) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy .
they were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place .
i had no trouble following it ( maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before ) .
the issue is how ms duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame .
i 've rewatched it on tv and video , and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen ( twice , or maybe three times , actually ) .
it seems hard to really pinpoint .
how many screenplays has he written ? ?
however , it is worth pointing out that at times you need to be a fast reader to fully appreciate the english subtitle option .
from her opening number , her classic `` friends '' , where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud , bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called `` i look good '' she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections .
a dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what ?
this and the land before time are the best animated films that don bluth has made !
the full title of this film is 'may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you 're dead ' , a rewording of the old irish toast 'may you have food and raiment , a soft pillow for your head ; may you be 40 years in heaven , before the devil knows you 're dead . '
christy does n't talk back .
i love this film .
i ca n't remember a pixar animation , other than the two toy story films , that i was laughing so hard .
one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back ... even if that means killing tarzan.this is a rarity -- a sequel that 's better than the original .
the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned , is that it is full of memorable characters , specifically statham , who gives a fantastic performance as the lead , and ray liotta , who spends most of the film in speedos , but gives a great performance none the less .
`` man on fire '' would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time , but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller .
the students ignore that .
the music/songs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices .
it would have made for a rousing beginning , and a better introduction of the troublesome trio : the shoveler ( william macy ) ; the blue raja ( hank azaria ) ; and mr .
the wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts , heightening the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their comeuppance .
emory hopes his local union will be able to re-open the mill , as they promise to do so.emory 's brother , lee already sees the writing on the wall .
these are the people who really enjoy the film .
why , he turns into a robot , complete with weapons and shield .
the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss .
the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i wo n't reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes .
great acting and comedy .
really , you could say its one big trendy video clip , since it 's all about the ramones
normally , i would say that canada , the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children , and 'time at the top ' does nothing to discount this theory !
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves , then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie .
different and exotic and similar to the justice league score , although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans ' rodent-shaped hearts.kevin conroy , as always , does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman .
sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief .
if your a horror fan & are looking for something a bit different , something slightly more intelligent & thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn .
the irish crew set off with those intentions .
the hohenzollern ( 1902/ii ) , `` kaiser wilhelm 's splendid yacht at the 34th st. pier , new york .
dev had first offered the music to be composed by sachin dev burman but burman da did not want dev to do the film .
i suspect that this movie was written by a gore vidal , as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era , if you knew history .
wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in 1935.very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades.great cast includes ; raymond massey ( arsenic and old lace ) sir cedric hardwick ( ghost of frankenstein ) ralph richardson ( time bandits ) and margaretta scott.early glimpses of helicopters , holograms , a rocket ship , and futuristic cities.this film was ahead of its time.directed by william cameron menzies ( invaders from mars ) its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis ( 1927 ) but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come , that was made in 1979. this movie has nothing to do with the original.h.g .
( or alongside ken berry in one memorable episode of 'mayberry rfd ' .
visconti , a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors , also includes arias by bizet and verdi that fit well in the context of the movie .
paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last !
not exactly a chipper upbeat film , but it is a quality film with an unusual story .
duchovony is aptly geeky and naive , and forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut-off , but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters ' changes as they are equally intrigued , repulsed and strangely attracted to pitt.the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside , this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing .
sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character.there is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all .
this is a trio of tales , `` shakti '' , `` devi '' , and `` kali '' , about an experimental commune ( or some such thing ) called the taylor-eriksson group , which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown , and left a bit of damage here and there , i 'd say .
10/10
for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas-missouri border wars during the american civil war .
in 2 minutes and 15 seconds , starting right after the credits , fuller is able to instantly power up the movie , to establish for us what the story is about , and to show us what kind of characters -- skip and candy -- we 're going to be involved with .
wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa .
i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store .
the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in `` a free soul '' , securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgm.if you like crawford in this type of role , do n't miss `` paid '' , which she did a year earlier , which is also among her best early talkie performances .
the next night i watched a scene with thelma todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress buster and jimmy with her sex appeal .
like that clever film , deathtrap labels itself ( a thriller about thrillers ) , sets it parameters ( `` a one-set , five character moneymaker '' ) and then proceeds to deconstruct its genre by revealing itself as `` the most outlandish and preposterous set of circumstances entertaining enough to persuade an audience to suspend its disbelief . ''
both films have a rambling , vague quality , along with complicated meanings and characters .
this is your only spoiler warning ... by today 's standards , this is more fun .
barbara stanwyck is , as always , absolutely amazing and wonderful .
we 're concerned about what 's in the shadows .
or.. you see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains .
it just defeats the purpose .
i really liked this movie .
so go get a copy of this game , learn it by playing the single-player campaign , then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself .
this is like grease meets south park .
) ; for the remake under review , the plot has been updated to the then-current wartime situation.anyway , i was mainly familiar with early british comedians through the films of will hay : given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings , smuggling and enemy agents , it 's very much in that vein ( it was actually scripted by hay 's regular writing team of marriott edgar , val guest and j.o.c .
it also showed me how in mainland china the indie rock scene exists , and that chinese people do know how to strum the guitar and get the house funking !
it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight .
it 's very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks , give it a try .
katherine heigl , marley shelton , denise richards , david boreanaz .
in the film 's most startling scene , the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation .
i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes .
all in all , this movie has , in my opinion , `` street cred '' .
the secret was revealed by on a 2004 uk documentary titled `` oliver !
it 's as if you would condemn ( or praise ) the newly born for his future life .
all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history , underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish .
it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective .
house of games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels .
the most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones .
the best of the best .
`` the garden of allah '' was one of the first feature length , 3-strip technicolor films .
i hope that the director will make another one
but would i choose this movie as my valentine 's day choice ?
it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie .
it is during just such a turn that we meet stanley iv .
sad .
though it 's not for everyone , it is a genuinely brilliant , darkly funny , even more often deeply disturbing tale about love , sex , personal liberty , and revenge , a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution .
this is a challenging journey but one worth taking - please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues .
while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines , films have about 120 minutes .
walter reed and jeff corey were familiar faces as well from other movies .
there 's not a moment , action , cut , or line that does n't have everything to do with the theme .
all of the old conflicts rearise , with the figures of keith and brian hovering throughout .
first , i 'm more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so-called 'a-list ' swedish actors in this film .
all the criticisms registered here have valid points .
another friend of mine who had n't seen the movie yet , advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a tim-burton-movie is still a tim-burton-movie ' .
jackie is at his absolute best here .
this family is so real and funny .
they make a fine romantic pair onscreen -- sigh ! anthony quinn is the mean , bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer .
it 's the same with `` first kid '' , which follows a similar pattern .
so , for the time being at least , maradona was el rey - he brought his argentine side to mexico as one of the favourites , and with a new manager - carlos bilardo replacing menotti.maradona is the hero of this story , a one-man world cup winning machine .
the music is old , but you really get used to it , and my daughter really loved it .
!
there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful .
i am hoping that more come out .
many films just seem like re-treads of old ideas , so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend passport to pimlico.the movie is set just after ww2 and the post-war shortages and rationing seem to be driving londoners `` barmy '' .
i am a very avid reader of margaret laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film .
the first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you , 'made in 1983 ' .
however , the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion , which again was over 30 years in the past .
ok , there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well .
he loves them .
very good !
it does have its flaws , but overall it was very enjoyable and i 'd highly recommend it to anyone who does n't mind a few subtitles .
i found grey garden 's to be a gripping film , an amazingly intimatelook at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea : forgetsociety and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a hugebrood of cats and raccoons , persuing their own interests rathermundainly , all the while chattering at the camera.big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros.have chosen to document .
i thought that ice age was an excellent movie !
and the entire thing is quite shallow , indeed : the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated.but all in all , verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie .
sure wish he 'd make more films .
fortunate for him , because it means he can witness a falling star and , and again , i 'm not making this up , turn into a claymation rabbit .
i really did n't expect much from brando as a singer , but he surprised me .
fontaine is great , but some others , particularly richard ney , ivy 's husband , are exceedingly wooden .
in greta he is still a hero , the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created , but in mansfield they still have n't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered ' were from there.many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing .
yep !
the plot is nothing new but sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions , with every frame carefully shot , and he is aided immeasurably by having stanwyck as his leading lady .
is it better for kyle david denman ) and teri ( megan paul ) to start their own lives and forget about the family or retain the values they were taught at home ?
if you sit through the first half hour and are n't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat .
some people said they would want to go back to the 60 's .

some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job .
it 's funny , it 's charming , it will make you cry a little , and it will warm your heart .
and though he talks fast , you catch every joke .
an opium den , a dirty little boy ( actually a midget ) , prostitutes galore , a violent fracas in a dive , a motel for sexual shenanigans , scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot , a boozer falling down the stairs , a racially mixed clientèle in a bar with asians , africans , and anglos treated equally , does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall ?
fast-paced , plenty of blood and gore and a nice , twisted sense of humor .
it 's a unique movie about two doctors , and i do n't want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones - plus the dialogue is great .
the characters ' clarity and sincerity in such an improbable story may both fascinate and annoy audiences .
about the only thing i did n't care for was all the mysticism , but i guess that is part and parcel of the genre .
for example , it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place .
i would give it 4 out of 10 .
the rock picked himself up just in time to break up a pin attempt on kurt angle .
the story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours , as well as for those who try to find deeper messages .
perfect had then cost michaels the intercontinental championship when he distracted him in a title match against marty janetty .
i even found a site which claimed that bette davis ' success was probably due to her luck .
also , the movie has plenty of funny moments , some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite , the one involves using masking tape .
that being said , the character of fay grimm starts off in the film , exactly where she was when henry fool ended , but by the end of the film ... fay 's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative .
is it already ?
seeing is believing , so until you start watching you will never know .i strongly recommend this masterpiece of series : lost ! !
well , life itself , for a start .
perhaps this 'odyssey ' had no english version because is not enough funny ... not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience .
i find it devoid of story which is fine by me .
the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up .
one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history .
man on fire is one of the year 's best movies .
the main storyline is about stanley yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp greenlake .
i really do think blonde and blonder is ace and i hope you hate me for it .
`` foxes '' is a great film .
excellent film from thaddeus o'sullivan featuring strong performances from a host of british and irish actors .
he has never been better .
my favorite is the valentino as the shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars .
lupin sets off for morocco , looking for a legendary treasure .
) , to the story , i find it very good !
three times does ahmad pronounce the absolute word 'time ' , in his declaration of love to the princess , answering her three questions at their first of three meetings .

uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero , g-girl .
women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes .
and for this one , it certainly was .
of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in .
you will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds , but do n't let that fool you , there is horror all over the place .
but it 's not like that , it 's far more than that , because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost , well it 's getting better every time .
it 's a shame it is n't more well known , but it is a gem deserving of attention .
the sound quality is second to none , from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks .
and the *dancing* -- again , the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect ' syndrome , as it does with sinatra 's singing .
but these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film .
but the good thing is , the movie does n't take itself too seriously , and there is plenty of fun - and some pretty cool editing - that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england mode.my particular favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful acting and directing here , and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully .
this is definitely a movie no fan of batman should be without .
nevertheless , peck 's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed .
***/****
the english subtitles follow the hebrew script very closely .
( let me get that out of the way . )
the final fight sequence is well staged by yuen woo ping who went on to coordinate the matrix .
he goes to a small hospital in florida for his internship because a girlfriend ( mya ) left him for a job as a tv producer .
let me start out by saying i 'm a big carrey fan .
one action sequence after another , we learn all of the character 's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it 's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue .
the highest compliment i can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing.for a small country the czech republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature , from hrabal , hasek and kundera to the films of menzel , sverak and numerous others .
the only information given was that it was a suspense thriller .
everything else was just ok. for what it is , i think the movie is awesome , but i like everything burton has done .
it 's definitely not for children .
we all have friends .
i 'm glad i did n't , because i certainly would have been missing out .
for me , one of the most moving scenes was when tom was talking to a official from the home office.i love 'im , an ' for what it 's worth , i think he loves me too'.it just does n't get better that that does it ?
from reading other reviews , i can see that i 'm not the only one who shed a tear .
based on a nebraska multiple murder in the 1950 's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place , `` in cold blood '' was filmed by master cinematographer conrad hall in stark black and white , and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio .
i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts .
rather , i 'm defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels .
this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my partner 's grandson was given it .
highly romanticized , beautifully shot , well written and acted , `` ril '' washes over you like a summer breeze as its plotless meandering breathes life into the characters such that at film 's end you 'll feel like an old friend of the family.a wonderfully crafted character-driven film from the director of `` driving miss daisy '' , `` ril '' is a somewhat obscure little `` sleeper '' which will appeal most to mature audiences .
oh , this is his rant about the backstage food , this is spot where he wants the amp to go to `` eleven '' , this is the spot where the guy makes the pint-sized stonehenge , etc ... contrasting to foabh , which seems to have more `` unexpected '' humor .
we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store , to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise.10/10
i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or , barring that , at least the cop should have got what was coming to him .
great stuff .
nice , pleasant , and funny , but not earth-shattering .
he secretly learns to hack into the computer , while gathering the admiration of his boss , karl malden , the enmity of his office rival , bob newhart , and the love of his inept secretary , maggie smith.some of the business details were a little murky to these non-business-oriented eyes but they 're believable enough and i got the general idea .
the fantastic mr. coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters .
but , for me ms. davis ' very poor attempt at an accent , and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch .
both are extremely likable and attractive.the supporting cast is a dream -- with the exception of sig ruman 's annoying faux russian .
it 's nice to see them out and about , still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history .
this is a film i decided to go and see because i 'm a huge fan of adult animation .
it 's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street .
as he gets more involved with the family , he realises there is a strong link between the fires , johnny and a frightened chinese youth who works for a laundry .
astaire gets two good solos with `` we saw the sea '' and `` i 'd rather lead a band . ''
he is trying to rebuild old wwi airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom ; a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planes -- etc. -- everlastingly ; this is wells ' comment on war versus progress .
but when the king finds out that othello snuck off with his daughter , desdemona , the king is infuriated , but excepts it .
i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonald-eddy 's pictures .
and the ending , now that 's sad , well ... for a 7-8 year old kid.i had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately , and found that the plot was too simple , the character , two-dimensional ...
fully of views , lectures and let you thinking ... and i 'm sure , you ca n't fell boried any second of a long 116 minutes .
they really do n't even try to talk to him .
this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola , but less of the magic of veronica voss .
once upon a time , there were different types of movies .
`` i doubt that. ``
at the time , it seemed like a momentous occasion whenever this day arrived , and `` bedknobs and broomsticks '' is one of the movies i can remember seeing this way.and from what i remember , it 's quite charming .
! ! ! ! ! ! !
impression : helplessness .
but what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons , particularly the oldest son , adam .
their facial expressions say everything.it is the story of a black servant , protée ( isaach de bankolé ) and a white woman , aimée ( giulia boschi ) .
the burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction .
this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep .
good at solving crime , bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times , guess who lagosi picks for his next intended victim .
douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson , dorothy malone ( oscar winner ) , robert stack ( oscar nominated ) , and lauren bacall that words can not describe .
yet these aspects of the physical universe ( it 's all quantum , trust me ! )
marc anthony is fine as samuel , radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita .
however , if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life , this film is for you .
still , it 's distracting to viewers like me who have read tons about the case .
again , i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway .
nicolas cage 's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing .
now , it 's hard to make a movie about a teenage boy who receives messages from a dead heavy metal star by playing one of his vintage records backwards without people scoffing at the premise .
i believe that is n't justified .
he is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter ( dakota fanning ) of a mexican businessman ( marc antony ) and his american-born wife ( radha mitchell ) .
it touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with , then at a turn of events that you meet someone else and that person is more of who you want to be with .
i make no judgment , because these are humans , just as we all are - love , courage , kindness , compassion , intelligence , humility : you name the attributes , they are all there , no matter what the package looks like.the `` trivia '' about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of `` ratzo '' is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles - how do you think he gets his input ?
since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley 's had low ceilings -- perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a `` smoke-filled bar '' hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling .
i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently , but 'peaches ' delivers the goods .
bring the wagon , stop the wagon etc .
i had few problems with this film , and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated .
the fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny , sea-front scenery that the film is mostly made up of.this is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set-pieces .
regulars really grow on you as well , such as the horse and donkey teens from maryland , most every married couple ( the parrots , the insects , and the cats to name a few ) and child-voiced character , and i 've really come to dig the ferret !
in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together .
!
i enjoyed joel in god of gamblers and many movies by leslie including better tomorrow .
although flawed in some fundamental ways , i still think tears of kali will appeal to most `` underground '' horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer .
there may be some truth is these characterisations , but fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the tories had opposed the reform act , which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs , and that they had benefited from william iv 's unconstitutional dismissal of a whig administration.lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen , and this one contains its share of inaccuracies .
`` i ca n't believe this was made in 43 , eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire ( 1951 ) .
!
i 'm disappointed that sean was not credited here on imdb.i can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher `` cash '' stakes , since his life would be on the line again anyway.i felt that sean played the role very well , and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew ashford who plays jack deveraux on days of our lives - the soap opera .
here , unlike in spike lee 's `` bamboozled , '' he seems to be using it to try and really say something.like 99.9 % of all of bakshi 's films , this one incorporates animation and live-action .
if you really want to know how most of the actors and directors in the hollywood scene `` made it '' to where they are , the vast majority will tell you ( assuming they will tell ) that a strange coincidence took place .
it dealt with issues of rascism and class .
director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy ( at least for 1928 ) cameo as himself .
human is not more than an animal with intelligence , intelligence that is so easy to be forgotten and eaten to the background by things that feel better and more satisfying at each and perhaps sudden moment .
john travolta and debra winger turn out two very believable performances as bud and sissy davis .
when this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler , it actually works , because we genuinely like these people .
the truly kiss of death .
it is much more of a comedy than that !
along with the quite wonderful corbett family , and all their stoic humorous support , corbett 's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous , yet as brash and as bold as he is , he is a very likable character , and it 's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jim.the film never sags for one moment , and it 's a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight , the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained , not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture { thank you alexis smith } .
i definitley suggest checking it out if you can .
what was he really saying ?
the powerful ( albeit cynical ) ending is what saves gojoe ; it clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a mere gore-fest .
this is a remarkably underrated film , and well worth keeping an eye out for .
) , jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful allure of temptation and addiction.this was not disney .
now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering .
they were as perfect in their parts as davis was in hers - they just did n't have as much to do .
it is a sad story , but i 've never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made .
her husband is a famous ex-baseball player ( gary busey ) and he wants to know what is going on .
david strathairn is a newcomer to this series as noah vosen , he 's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels .
the family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her , only by existing .
couples , in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next , or who will say `` i love you '' first .
never has anyone dominated a season like he did .
conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances .
still , very nice entry into the dirty harry series of movies .
